The problem is that there isn\'t a lot of patches (a patch is like an instance of a class in a classic object-oriented programming language) dedicated to user interface in Quartz Composer.</p>\n<p>That\'s where Origami steps in:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Origami provides a set of tools for Quartz Composer that make interaction prototyping a lot easier.</p>\n<p>Animations, transitions, buttons, layers, phones, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I recommend to watch <a href="https://vimeo.com/85578380">this video</a> to get a brief overview of what is possible with Origami. It\'s intriguing, it looks promising and it motivates me to learn Quartz Composer more seriously.</p>',frontmatter:{date:"2014-02-05",readableDate:"05 February 2014",title:"Interaction prototyping with Origami",showPageTitle:null,excerptLine:null,excerptQuote:{name:"Facebook",quote:"Origami provides a set of tools for Quartz Composer that make interaction prototyping a lot easier."}},fields:{path:"/2014/02/origami-quartz-composer/"}}},pathContext:{id:"/Users/ashen/Code/solarsailer.net/content/posts/2014-02-05-origami-quartz-composer.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
