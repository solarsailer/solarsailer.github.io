It looks promising and great. There are some nice ideas, akin to iOS 7, like depth (automatically integrated by a z-axis with live shadows rendering for developers) or transitions and animations as first-class citizens.</p>\n<p>Bonus? A <a href=\"http://www.google.com/design/\">comprehensive set of guidelines</a> with a lot of examples.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is some bullshit lines lurking inside the documentation…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Create a visual language that synthesizes classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science. […]</p>\n<p>A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion. The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Please, oh please, don't let marketing people write technical papers.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I'm really eager to see how it will be implemented in Android &#x26; the Google web apps (if I understood well, the current Android L preview is not completely converted to Material Design yet).</p>\n<p>There's still a lot of things that I don't like about Android and there's still a lot of rough edges (the awful black navigation bar, the heavy use of small typography, weird transitions &#x26; cie), but it's a great step forward for the platform. <em>And there's even a decent status bar now!</em></p>\n<p>The real problem for Google is to force developers to adapt to the new style. It's the fourth Android redesign (if I recount well) and the majority of the Android apps are still looking bad. I hope that this time, developers will rejoice and follow Google's lead.</p>",frontmatter:{date:"2014-07-01",readableDate:"01 July 2014",title:"Material Design",showPageTitle:null},fields:{path:"/2014/07/material-design/"}}},pathContext:{id:"/Users/ashen/Code/solarsailer.net/content/posts/2014-07-01-material-design.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
