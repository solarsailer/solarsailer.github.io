      "content_html": "<p>I had the chance to go to Singapore twice recently. The first time was in June for one week, and the second time in the last two weeks. It was for work, but all in all, I still had almost 3 full week-ends to discover the city properly.</p>\n<p><strong>Singapore is really incredible</strong>. It's full of surprises, with gigantic skyscrapers, mind-blowing structures and some ancient places hidden inside the districts (although not as frequently as what you can find in Japan, for example).</p>\n<p>It mixes many asian cultures. The official language is English, but many others are spoken everywhere (chinese, indian, malay, indonesian, etc.). Food is available in abundance and diversity<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>. The city is really busy during the day (a lot less at night in my opinion), and everything seems to change quite often (eg. governement and companies are not afraid to tear down a building to build another one 10 years later). Men presence is omnipresent: new lands are created on the sea, and nature is tightly contained. It's fascinating, even though the country is an environmental aberration (overuse of air conditioning, for example).</p>\n<p>There's no season, and it's always the same weather: 28-32°C (probably around 40°C felt), warm, <em>extremely humid</em>, and cloudy with occasional rains or thunderstorms. Even at night (which starts around 19:30), it will still be warm (just 2-3°C cooler if you are lucky). You could be in short and t-shirt all year, and if you stay 30 min outside, you'll inevitably sweat.</p>\n<p>There are tunnels and malls everywhere, so if you want to avoid the heat, you just have to go inside a building to cool down<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>, \"thanks to\" the overabondance of AC<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Finally, Singapore is really, <strong>really</strong>, safe. As a man, I don't feel unsafe most of the time, but still, you can feel the difference there. It can be 3:00 at night and you'll never feel threatened. You can forget something and go back one day later and find it again. It's when you go back home that you can really grasp how nice it is to walk so peacefully.</p>\n<h2>Tips</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Foodcourts (gathering of stalls serving a few different meals each) are everywhere. Some of them can be a bit dodgy — you will have a rating on each stall, from C to A. From what I've understood, even a A is not necessarily clean. However, I never got sick (but I never tried a C either).</li>\n<li>Grab a tourist SIM at the airport (you'll need your passport as a foreigner). For a cheap 12 SGD (~8 EUR), you'll get 100GB of data for 7 days. <a href=\"https://www.m1.com.sg/Mobile/prepaid-plans/tourist-sim\">I recommend the M1 plans</a> - for iPhone users, you can also get one as an eSim.</li>\n<li>You can manage without cash, but still, I would recommend to withdraw 20-40 SGD for a week to eat in the cheap foodcourts (many of them don't accept credit cards). As a Singaporean, I don't think it's as necessary thanks to other types of payments (like <a href=\"https://www.nets.com.sg\">Nets</a>), but for a tourist, you'll find yourself blocked if you don't have a little bit of cash. This is a surprise, because there are <strong>so many</strong> payment methods available everywhere.</li>\n<li>You don't need to buy city transport tickets (subway or bus). Just use your contactless credit card at the entries and exits, and you'll be debited at the end of the month (or week, I don't really know) automatically. This is so handy.</li>\n<li>Taxis are cheap. Going from the airport to the city center is like 20 SGD (14 EUR). In some places, you'll find one really easily, but it's not always the case at certain moments of the day. There are some applications to do that, but it seemed a bit of a pain to use as a foreigner.</li>\n<li>Restaurants don't show the final prices in the menus. You'll have to add some taxes at the end (I would say around 15%-20%). I'm not sure it's everywhere, but it happens often.</li>\n<li>I never tipped for anything. I didn't feel like I was supposed to. Which is nice<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup>.</li>\n<li>Meals can vary a lot in price. In the foodcourts, you can usually find something around 4 SGD (2.5 EUR). In \"normal\" restaurants, it's more around 15-25 SGD. But it can also be way higher.</li>\n<li>The Singaporean Dollar is very interesting for us Europeans (1 SGD is around 0.66 EUR). It reduces the costs significantly at the time of this writing. Life is not cheap in Singapore, so this helps.</li>\n<li>Buy some Tiger Balms. You can find the white and red for 3-5 SGD (2-3 EUR) each. Which is 4-5 times cheaper than in France.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Places</h2>\n<p>Some places I went to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Marina Bay Sands</strong>: the 3-towers skyscraper with a \"boat\" at the top, and probably the most famous building in Singapore. I went to \"Cé La Vi\" rooftop, which has a nice view on Gardens By The Bay. Go to the mall nearby (The Shoppe at Marina Bay Sands) to climb to the Skydeck and watch the light show during the evening. The ArtScience Museum is a pretty building too.</li>\n<li><strong>Buddha Tooth Relic Temple</strong>: a brand new Buddhist temple that does not look new. The interior is really nice, and there's an interesting museum inside.</li>\n<li><strong>Chinatown</strong>: very nice neighbourhood with lots of restaurants, close to the previous temple.</li>\n<li><strong>Thian Hock Keng Temple</strong>: this temple is surrounded by skyscrapers in a moody district to walk in.</li>\n<li><strong>Gardens By The Bay</strong>: a park near the CBD, with artificial supertrees (the skyway at the top of the tree gives a nice view around) and two domes to visit. I really love this place. It's unique. There's also a great foodcourt in the park called \"Satay By The Bay\".</li>\n<li><strong>Jewel</strong>: it's an artificial park in the center of the airport. They built a huge fountain coming from the ceiling… it's crazy and superb at the same time.</li>\n<li><strong>Zoo</strong>: I wouldn't recommend this. My trip and safaris in Tanzania has probably destroyed any interest I could have in a zoo.</li>\n<li><strong>Haw Par Villa</strong>: it's a bit outside the city center. It was designed by the family who invented the Tiger Balm onguent. Creepy as hell<sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a href=\"#fn-5\" class=\"footnote-ref\">5</a></sup>, but worth a visit.</li>\n<li><strong>Botanic Gardens</strong>: a big park loved by Singopereans and families. It's ok.</li>\n<li><strong>Southern Ridges</strong>: a long walk in the south of the city. I started from Kent Ridges until the Harbourfront MRT station. The section between Kent Ridges to Alexandra Arch is boring. The part after Henderson Waves (to the MRT station) is not interesting either. <em>But from Alexandra Arch (included) and Henderson Waves (included), it's really great.</em></li>\n<li><strong>CBD</strong> and <strong>Lau Pau Sat</strong>: a famous foodcourt in the CBD (Central Business District), surrounded by high towers and business(wo)men.</li>\n<li><strong>1-Altitude</strong>: one of the highest tower with a rooftop. Panoramic view of Singapore.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are many other places I still need to do (Little India, Pulau Ubin, a few temples, MacRichie, etc.). And I still didn't try a Kaya toast breakfast… That will be for another time!</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>Just try a Chicken Rice or black or white Chai Tow Kway (Carrot Cake) if you want something \"typical\".</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>In an interesting way, I would compare the city to Montréal during the winter - you can navigate almost exclusively in man-built structure to avoid the harsh weather, but in Singapore, it will be from the heat, not the cold and snow. And all year, not just the winter.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-3\">\n<p>It often happens that it will be <strong>too</strong> cold inside buildings.</p>\n<p>  It's also <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/3/23/8278085/singapore-lee-kuan-yew-air-conditioning\">probably one of the reasons</a> behind the economical success of the country:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ITV</strong>: Anything else besides multicultural tolerance that enabled Singapore's success?</p>\n<p><strong>Lee Kuan Yew</strong>: Air conditioning. Air conditioning was a most important invention for us, perhaps one of the signal inventions of history. It changed the nature of civilization by making development possible in the tropics.</p>\n<p>Without air conditioning you can work only in the cool early-morning hours or at dusk. The first thing I did upon becoming prime minister was to install air conditioners in buildings where the civil service worked. This was key to public efficiency.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"#fnref-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-4\">\n<p>Tipping is such a stupid custom. The sole purpose is to not pay the employees correctly by default. Include the cost of the salaries in the f* price, and boom, done.

If we were more thoughtful with what we build, it could be possible, but to keep a sane and manageable codebase in our current world, we need to accept that we will lose compatibility and devices over time.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That is not engineering. That’s just lazy programming. Engineering is understanding performance, structure, limits of what you build, deeply. Combining poorly written stuff with more poorly written stuff goes strictly against that. To progress, we need to understand what and why are we doing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm also guilty of that. Look, this website uses <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\">Gatsby</a> to generate a few static pages, and this requires 242M of dependencies to build it (not run it, hopefully).</p>\n<p>However, the result is extremely fast and satisfying for the user, and the developer experience is top-notch, at the expense of an increase in size of the exported bundle on initial (and uncached) load. Is this a reasonable tradeoff?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>At the end:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Business won’t care. Neither will users. They are only learned to expect what we can provide. We (engineers) say every Android app takes 350 MB? Ok, they’ll live with that. We say we can’t give them smooth scrolling? Ok, they’ll live with a phone that stutter. We say “if it doesn’t work, reboot”? They’ll reboot. After all, they have no choice.</p>\n<p>There’s no competition either. Everybody is building the same slow, bloated, unreliable products. Occasional jump forward in quality does bring competitive advantage (iPhone/iOS vs other smartphones, Chrome vs other browsers) and forces everybody to regroup, but not for long.</p>\n<p>So it’s our mission as engineers to show the world what’s possible with today’s computers in terms of performance, reliability, quality, usability. If we care, people will learn. And there’s nobody but us to show them that it’s very much possible. If only we care.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On this, I don't completely agree. Yes, in general, people are mostly stuck with what we provide, but users are way too forgiving, and most of the time, don't even see the quality problem<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> — only a fraction perceives it.<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup> Even engineers working on products don't necessarily see that something's wrong. How many engineers don't care about design, visual consistency, coherence, and speed, for example?<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup> How many don't see that their users are struggling?</p>\n<p>But there's a choice to be made by users: choose carefully, invest and learn, accept to spend a bit more on something better and more durable, change less often, and don't restrict yourself to the most ugly and cheap solution all the time, just because that was the first and easy choice.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>That's a shame and such a waste, though. I don't know if we can do better with our current tools.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>Case in point: Windows is still a complete mess — the average bar of software quality on this platform is abysmal, and most people are completely okay with that — they don't even care. The only thing that raised the bar on Windows is Electron apps, and these came with their own set of tradeoffs, and are almost universally considered as subpar and second-tier citizens on other OSes. <em>It's a vicious cycle: if the platform owner doesn't care, the developers won't care, thus the users too.</em></p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-3\">\n<p>This, though, poses another question: should we care about high quality if it doesn't matter for 80% of the users? I do think we should and I'm happy we still have craftsmanship in this world, but maybe it's only us, designers and nerds, that spend too much time pondering about that.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-4\">\n<p>And it's a bit easy to say this without knowing the business constraints. Our society pushes for fast at the expense of doing things right and correctly — by <em>taking the time</em>.

That is, software speedy both in function and interface. Software with minimal to no lag between wanting to activate or manipulate something and the thing happening. Lightness.</p>\n<p>Software that’s speedy usually means it’s focused. Like a good tool, it often means that it’s simple, but that’s not necessarily true. Speed in software is probably the most valuable, least valued asset. To me, speedy software is the difference between an application smoothly integrating into your life, and one called upon with great reluctance.</p>\n<p>[…] Because — it’s not <em>quite</em> as fast. We’re talking milliseconds, but it’s enough that you <em>feel</em> the difference.</p>\n<p>[…] Still, the slowness feels indicative of unseen rot on the inside of the machine. The slowness is like an off smell. I don’t trust the application as much as I would if it didn’t slow down […]</p>\n<p>Speed and reliability are often intuited hand-in-hand. Speed can be a good proxy for general engineering quality. If an application slows down on simple tasks, then it can mean the engineers aren’t obsessive detail sticklers. Not always, but it can mean disastrous other issues lurk. I want all my craftspeople to stickle.</p>\n<p>[…] I love software that does this: Software that unbloats over time. This should be the goal of all software. The longer it’s around, the more elegant it should become. Smooth over like a river stone.</p>\n<p>[…] But why is slow bad?

Later is where good intentions go to die. Later is a broken back and a bent spirit. Later says “all-nighters are temporary until we’ve got this figured out.” Unlikely. Make the change now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Page 185:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Being clear about what demands excellence and what’s perfectly okay just being adequate is a great way to bring a sense of calm into your work. You’ll worry less, you’ll accept more. “That’s fine” is such a wonderfully relaxing way to work most of the time. Save the occasional scrutiny for the differentiating details that truly matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Page 182:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We’ve been practicing disagree and commit since the beginning, but it took Bezos’s letter to name the practice. Now we even use that exact term in our discussions. “I disagree, but let’s commit” is something you’ll hear at Basecamp after heated debates about specific products or strategy decisions.</p>\n<p>Companies waste an enormous amount of time and energy trying to convince everyone to agree before moving forward on something. What they’ll often get is reluctant acceptance that masks secret resentment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Page 252:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jean-Louis Gassée, who used to run Apple France, describes this situation as the choice between two tokens. When you deal with people who have trouble, you can either choose to take the token that says “It’s no big deal” or the token that says “It’s the end of the world.” Whichever token you pick, they’ll take the other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Page 20:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It begins with this idea: <em>your company is a product</em>.</p>\n<p>Yes, the things you make are products (or services), but your company is the thing that makes those things. That’s why your company should be your best product. […] That, like product development, progress is achieved through iteration. If you want to make a product better, you have to keep tweaking, revising, and iterating. The same thing is true with a company.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>But when you think of the company as a product, you ask different questions: Do people who work here know how to use the company? Is it simple? Complex? Is it obvious how it works? What’s fast about it? What’s slow about it? Are there bugs? What’s broken that we can fix quickly and what’s going to take a long time?</p>\n<p>A company is like software. It has to be usable, it has to be useful. And it probably also has bugs, places where the company crashes because of bad organizational design or cultural oversights.</p>\n<p>When you start to think about your company as a product, all sorts of new possibilities for improvement emerge. When you realize the way you work is malleable, you can start molding something new, something better.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The delightful clickiness of it, its precision, the appearance of etched metal… Delicious. How could we possibly translate this to a digital user interface? You’d just be tapping on glass.</p>\n<p>[…] The only issue was that my big silly thumb would totally obscure the control. […]</p>\n<p>But we didn’t have to also emulate the limitations of the physical world along with its wonderful tactile qualities: this is the digital world. We can make tiny phones fly. We can use a machine brain to pick the right settings for you.</p>\n<p>We can make the dial expand gracefully as you select an exposure time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is probably my favorite part of the interface. Everything about it feels and looks perfect; Ben’s custom spring physics, my visual design iterations, and Jelmar’s completely custom typeface we use for the numerals. Three people worked hard on this little doodad — and most users probably wouldn’t even notice the work we put into it!</p>\n<p>I would argue that’s how you know that you’ve made something well.</p>\n<p><strong>When you come across an article set in a superb typeface for reading, some excellent airport signage or a well designed door handle, you don’t think about it or even notice it.

      "content_html": "<p>I was watching <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_9D6ZIEQalc\">this talk</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jessiechar\">Jessie Char</a> and it reminded me of some thoughts I have each time I attend a meetup or conference.</p>\n<p>I think we could improve these events with some little tweaks that would make the experience of every attendee better.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Manage the noise level</strong>. This is <em>the most important</em> thing. Noise must be low during the \"networking phase\", which means that the venue should not produce too much sound acoustically (and if it's not possible, simply reduce the number of people attending your event). People should be able to talk to each other at more than 20cm away after a talk. I can't count the number of times I approached a group, finding that I couldn't hear one single word because the room was too loud.</li>\n<li><strong>Get 3 mics</strong> at least. One for the moderator, one for the speaker (or group of speakers), and one for the audience. The audience also wants to listen to the questions. The speaker or moderator should repeat the question after hearing it anyways, but this common practice is often forgotten, unfortunately.</li>\n<li><strong>Fresh air access</strong>. This is more for conferences, since meetups are usually shorter. There's nothing worse than not being able to go outside for a few minutes every hour. Headaches and odors await otherwise.</li>\n<li><strong>Find ways to nudge people to talk to each other</strong>. There will be groups of people that know each other, so the task is, by default, harder for strangers. Give them help, find ways to make interaction more natural. It's not that hard, I think (but it depends on the venue and what your event is about). For conferences, what I like is when other activities are offered (games for examples) — it's good to have breaks. And many times you can meet new people more easily in a different setup.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce</strong>. <strong>The</strong>. <strong>Number</strong>. <strong>Of</strong>. <strong>Attendees</strong>. I get it that organizers don't want a small number of people at their meetups or conferences. It's not as profitable and it's not as good for the press/reputation, but participants will thank you. 1) It helps people talking to each other after a talk. 2) It reduces noise. 3) It creates intimacy and makes people ask more questions to the speakers. 4) And, in fact, it reduces your cost and makes everything more manageable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There're many other things to do, but these are my main frustrations. For the rest, the talk linked above is excellent! :)</p>",

It should put people at ease. So you have all these little cues that make people feel like they can explore the tech, they don’t have to worry about being caught in a trap or inadvertently triggering a nuclear meltdown.</p>\n<p>AMY: But while human-centered design had permeated the world of consumer technology, not every industry has been as quick to adopt it.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>AMY: In January 2018, an employee at The Hawaii Emergency Management Agency mistakenly issued a state-wide alert that went straight to residents’ cell phones. “Ballistic Missile Threat inbound to Hawaii,” it read. “Seek immediate Shelter. This is not a drill.”</p>\n<p>[…] This was supposed to be a safety drill. But the guy at the controls clicked on the wrong link. And you kind of can’t blame him… when you see the screen that he was looking at.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>KHOI: I mean, on the one hand, technology that consumers interact with has gotten so much better. We don’t have manuals anymore. Everything is much, much more intuitive. And so, design has really come a long way in that respect. But there’s this whole other sector of technology – the stuff that you and I don’t get to interact with everyday. The stuff that–  power plants or emergency centers. That stuff still is pretty rough still.</p>\n<p>CLIFF: The stuff that really needs to be redesigned is not apps and things like that. It’s the gnarly ugly enterprise software out there that sort of has escaped real scrutiny right? So, let’s say some piece of software for managing a trucking fleet.</p>\n<p>AMY: Too many of these kinds of tools still aren’t streamlined and friendly and easy-to-use the way our smart phones and laptops are. They have not yet, in other words, received the benefit of human-centered design.</p>\n<p>CLIFF: All these things actually, they exist almost in this kind of like “ghetto of inattention”. The greatest opportunities are within those things, this like gnarly machinery of everyday commerce that really powers the world we live in, but that has escaped notice.</p>\n</blockquote>",

You have to swipe from the bottom of the screen, which puts the app back inside its icon.</p>\n<p>By default, at the bottom (where the chin was), the home indicator is <strong>always visible</strong> in an app. It's the black bar you can see on this screenshot:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/home-indicator.jpg\" alt=\"Home indicator default state\"></p>\n<p>For the moment, it's a permanent indicator if the app does not specify a different behavior.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>See what it does in action:</p>\n<figure>\n  <video src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/action.mp4\" width=\"221.5\" height=\"480\" controls muted loop>\n    Your browser doesn't support videos.

With the haptic feedback, it's actually very nice to play with.</p>\n<h2>Changing the behavior in Unity</h2>\n<p>However, this (default) behavior is not great for games. It's too bright and it hides a small portion of the bottom part of the screen. Which can be confusing in games like Steredenn, where many things are displayed at the same time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/steredenn.jpg\" alt=\"Home indicator in Steredenn\"></p>\n<p>Fortunately, Unity (well, technically, it's iOS) provides 2 ways to change the home indicator. Obviously with Unity, the correct one is not the one you would expect.</p>\n<p>You can find these settings by following this procedure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <code class=\"language-text\">Edit → Project Settings → Player</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/unity-01.jpg\" alt=\"Open the Player&#x27;s settings\"></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Then, click on the iOS tab, and find the \"Other Settings\" area.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/unity-02.jpg\" alt=\"Find &#x22;Other Settings&#x22;\"></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Finally, we are interested in 2 settings: \"Hide home button on iPhone X\" and \"Defer system gestures on edges\".</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/unity-03.jpg\" alt=\"&#x22;Hide home button on iPhone X&#x22; and &#x22;Defer system gestures on edges&#x22;\"></p>\n<h2>\"Hide home button on iPhone X\"</h2>\n<p>\"Hide home button on iPhone X\", the one that looks like what we want, is, of course, the <em>wrong one</em>.</p>\n<p>This setting hides the home indicator after a certain inactivity delay. If the user taps on the screen, the home indicator appears again in its full bright glory. In a game, where you will tap all the time, it's the same as showing the indicator permanently.</p>\n<p>Note that this setting can be useful sometimes. For example, if you are doing a video player, or a game that does not require user inputs often, this is what you want. I think there is ways to toggle this behavior when needed.</p>\n<p>This is what YouTube does, for example (it's hard to see cos' the home indicator is black here, but look at the bottom):</p>\n<figure>\n  <video src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/hide.mp4\" controls muted loop>\n    Your browser doesn't support videos.

Perfect.</li>\n<li>To go back to the home screen, you have to do the gesture twice. This is also nice, since it prevents accidental gestures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The \"bottom\" checkbox is enough if you only want to change the home indicator behavior. The other checkboxes can be used for Control Center and other gestures on iPad, I think.</p>\n<p>This is what Alto's Adventure does, as well as Steredenn:</p>\n<figure>\n  <video src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/defer.mp4\" controls muted loop>\n    Your browser doesn't support videos.

First, I noticed the packaging. Unlike the high-quality large-format cardboard boxes with soft colors and thoughtful art, GTR came in a compact, cheap, plastic tub that wasn’t much bigger than a large paperback book. Second, and more jarring, was the game's art. It had a bright color palette and cartoonish characters that seemed like they belonged in a children’s clip art computer game.</p>\n<p>[He] started unpacking the game and patiently explaining the rules. What immediately struck me was the mechanic allowing the player to choose what type any given card would be—one of a few choices that would automatically exclude the others. GTR appeared to be full of intrigue and strategy, and there were multiple ways to win. […]</p>\n<p>In less than a decade, how could a game whose ranking still remains relatively high (150) on Board Game Geek — just a few places above Magic: The Gathering and a few places lower than Carcassonne — have totally disappeared? What happened? […]</p>\n<p>\"It’s one of those games, you just recognize the genius of the design of it,\" Lozito told Ars. \"This is one of the quintessential big games in a small box. Every time you sit down to play it it plays differently, the cards are all crazy. I looked at the game and I have no idea how his brain could come up with such a complex game out of 125 cards or whatever.\" […]</p>\n<p>As GTR continued to gather critical and cult-classic steam, word started getting back to [co-creator Carter] that one of the game’s primary problems was its awful production—those nausea-inducing colors and a cheap plastic box. […]</p>\n<p>[After the Kickstarter's success], this should have been the moment that Carter seized game-design glory. With a successful production, he could have taken the game from indie cult favorite to something much bigger. But according to Rao, this influx of cash instead represented the beginning of the end.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's a description from Ed Carter, one of the \"co-creators\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Early on, Glory To Rome was often called \"San Juan on Steroids,\" but it would probably be more accurate to call it \"San Juan meets Magic The Gathering.\" There are 40 different cards in Glory To Rome and each one has a unique ability. Only four of them are sensible \"Improve your X by Y\" abilities—the rest are ridiculous, convoluted powers like \"Incomplete MARBLE structures provide function.\" That generates 760 different two-card combinations and many thousands of three-card ones. I've played hundreds of games of GTR over the years so I've thought about a lot of these combinations, but certainly not all of them.</p>\n<p>Also, while most games are balanced using a stable equilibrium with the aim that no card should be so overpowering that it breaks the game, Glory To Rome is balanced using astable equilibrium—our aim was that in the right combinations, virtually every card would be able to contribute to a runaway victory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was never aware that the game was unavailable. I got a copy of the French version (by Filosofia) a few years ago when it was in store almost anywhere in France, in a reprinted and decent version, so this story is all news to me. It's funny to think that the game was \"everywhere\" here, but unavailable in its home-country.</p>\n<p>It's a shame though, since the game is really, <em>really</em> great.</p>\n<p><em>Side note: the work by <a href=\"https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/643046/poll-would-you-buy-re-design-glory-rome\">Heiko Günther</a> is beautiful too. I think that the French version is clearer in an actual game, but wow this is pretty.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>This article makes me think that many boardgames disappear each year, going unnoticed and forgotten forever.</p>\n<p>I wrote about <a href=\"https://matthieuoger.com/2015/09/quantum-post-mortem/\">Quantum</a> before, one of my favorite boardgames, which is out of stock too. I looked for a new copy a few months ago, and to my surprise, wasn't able to find one. I looked today, and the game is not even listed on most sites anymore.</p>\n<p>Each year<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>, an increasing number of new games is released, and each year, an even bigger number is retired. The disturbing thing, however, is that most of these games are, actually, great games.</p>\n<p>Only a small and highly-successful portion of all the boardgames will be kept forever (Catan, Race for the Galaxy, Carcassonne, Monopoly, 7 Wonders, etc.). Are those the very best of the best? Or just the most successful ones?</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>Like videogames, the number of boardgames produced a year keeps getting bigger. I don't have the numbers, but I've read that the production of the last few years alone might be higher than the whole combined number of games created a few decades before.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

      "content_html": "<p>It's been a long time since my last post (more than two years, in fact). And the reason is absurd.</p>\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: I have redesigned Solar Sailer, making the <a href=\"/\">home page</a> the most important one and refocusing this site as a way to find me on Internet. The blog is relegated to a secondary part of the website. I still plan to publish articles, but the focus of Solar Sailer is to quickly know who I am, what I've done and where you can find me.</p>\n<p>The rest is a bonus. However, I'm still planning to expand this website in new ways — adding a portfolio and a resume, most notably.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/\"> <img src=\"/images/posts/2018-07-20-reboot.jpg\" alt=\"New redesign and home page\"> </a></p>\n<p>If you want to read more about why it took so long, continue. Otherwise, you know everything. 😉</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I was using <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com\">Jekyll</a> to generate this blog and hosting it with <a href=\"https://pages.github.com\">GitHub Pages</a> (Jekyll is maintained by GitHub, so the workflow to publish a Jekyll site on GitHub is dead simple if you accept their dependencies and constraints). Then, one day, GitHub said that they were deprecating the Markdown engine that I was using, affecting a few posts I wrote.</p>\n<p>I wanted to redesign this site for a long time, so instead of just updating the posts, I decided to rewrite the whole blog (like every developer do each time they have a small change to do — it's our curse).</p>\n<p>I experimented. I designed 6 or 8 layouts. I was never happy, and I never gave me the time to finish it properly. When I started to implement a new design, I let it wither for a few months. And when I came back, I just ditched it all. Again. And again. And again.</p>\n<p>I moved the blog to <a href=\"https://gohugo.io\">Hugo</a>. Then I came back to Jekyll once more. I modernized everything. Then I was fed up with Jekyll again, so I tried <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\">Gatsby</a>. And I did other things, abandoning the redesign once again. Meanwhile, and even if I had dozens of drafts, I couldn't update the old blog with new articles. So it languished there, in its infamous uglyness (something I was not proud of, calling myself a <em>designer</em>).</p>\n<p>And finally, I retried Gatsby recently and completed a new design. It's not perfect. It's not well tested on older browsers. But it works, in a good enough way for me — I have already spent too much time on it.</p>\n<p>I've also cut the dependency I had on GitHub Pages. I'm still using GitHub to host this website, but the workflow is separated and I'm free to use what I want.</p>\n<p><strong>It's time to ship.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>More than just a simple redesign, I wanted to reboot the site to add a <strong>portfolio</strong>, a <strong>resume</strong>, a <strong>documentation·codex·tutorials</strong>, as well as a <strong>photo</strong> and <strong>automation</strong> sections. Of course, if I wanted to do it all, I would never have finished anything, so I just focused on a simple redesign at the time being, keeping in mind that the site would be expanded later.</p>\n<p>The goal, in the end, is to do all that — if I'm motivated enough. A good start would be to publish new articles with a regular schedule.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Another thing that was ticking for this website was the \"deprecation\" of <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html\">HTTP by Chrome in an upcoming update</a>. By deprecation, I mean that Chrome will show an \"Unsecure\" flag on non-HTTPS websites. HTTP will always work, but it will be relegated to a legacy protocol that nobody should continue to use.</p>\n<p>I was in a hurry to complete this reboot before this update. I soft-launched the new site a few weeks ago, and tweaked it since. And now it's official.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>To be a little bit exhaustive:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have 6 designs in Sketch files, plus a few more that I did directly in the browser.</li>\n<li>I did more than 50 logos. And I'm still not satisfied by the one I use now (it's not the best that I did, but I think it fits better with the layout and what I wanted to do). It's so hard to capture the essence of something personal. It's a blank canvas without any constraints.</li>\n<li>I tried 4 or 5 blog engines (<a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com\">Jekyll</a>, <a href=\"http://www.metalsmith.io\">Metalsmith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\">Gatsby</a>, <a href=\"https://gohugo.io\">Hugo</a> and others). I even toyed with the idea of creating my own.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm so exhausted by this whole process and that's mainly why I'm so long to end this blog post. 😇</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I hope you'll like it.</p>\n<h2>Update <span class=\"more\">18 October 2018</span></h2>\n<p>I've renamed the site to simply \"Matthieu Oger\". The \"brand\" I was trying to create with the \"Solar Sailer\" name was not working at all. It's better to just drop it and use my name as of now.

      "content_html": "<p><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/dwarf-fortress-creator-on-how-hes-42-towards-simulating-existence/\">Tarn Adams</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s funny how I have popular bugs, right? You shouldn’t have popular bugs. […] I added taverns to fortress mode, so the dwarves will go to a proper establishment, get mugs, and make orders, and they’ll drink in the mug. And, you know, things happen, mugs get spilled, there’s some alcohol on the ground.</p>\n<p>Now, the cats would walk into the taverns, right, and because of the old blood footprint code from, like, eight years ago or something, they would get alcohol on their feet. It was originally so people could pad blood around, but now any liquid, right, so they get alcohol on their feet. And then I wanted to add cleaning stuff so when people were bathing, or I even made eyelids work for no reason, because I do random things sometimes. So cats will lick and clean themselves, and on a lark, when I made them clean themselves I’m like, ‘Well, it’s a cat. When you do lick cleaning, you actually ingest the thing that you’re cleaning off, right? They make hairballs, so they must swallow something, right?' And so the cats, when they cleaned the alcohol off their feet, they all got drunk. Because they were drinking.</p>\n<p>But the numbers were off on that. I had never thought about, you know, activating inebriation syndromes back when I was adding the cleaning stuff. I was just like, ‘Well, they ingest it and they get a full dose,’ but a full dose is a whole mug of alcohol for a cat-sized creature, and it does all the blood alcohol size-based calculations, so the cats would get sick and vomit all over the tavern.</p>\n<p>The original bug report is, ‘There’s cat vomit all over my tavern, and there’s a few dead cats,’ or whatever, and they’re like, ‘Why? This is broken.’</p>\n<p>People helped me with this. We were all looking and figuring out, ‘What the heck is going on here?’, and that was the chain of events. It’s like doing the detective work to figure out that entire chain of events is what happened. You can see how adding just a tavern that gave the opportunity for spilling alcohol, which was really uncommon before, now all the spilled alcohol starts to, form in one location where something could start to happen. You activate bugs and little parts of code from eight, six years ago where you just didn’t balance the numbers because it didn’t matter. […]</p>\n<p><strong>PC Gamer: So the cats’ inebriation system was just based on any organism would have the potential to get drunk.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, right now it’s any creature that has blood, and that includes, like, an octopus. I don’t know if an octopus can get drunk or not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The way the different systems are all interacting together is so fascinating. Especially when the outcome becomes something like this. :)</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don’t even use version control. If you don’t know what that is then you’re not gonna yell at me. If you even know what version control is you’re gonna be like, ‘You don’t use version control? You don’t use source control? What is wrong with you? How can you even work?’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm still baffled to know that many game developers (or other developers) work without version control. It seems so dangerous, but… well.</p>",

Delight is a well-balanced weight on the shoulder, in the hand. Delight is the just-right tension on the aperture ring between stops. Delight is a single battery lasting all day. Delight is being able to knock out a 10,000 iso image and know it'll be usable. Delight is extracting gorgeous details from the cloak of shadows. Delight is firing off a number of shots without having to wait for the buffer to catch up. Delight is constraints, joyfully embraced.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bonus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It should not exist. It is one of those unicorn-like consumer products that so nails nearly every aspect of its being — from industrial to software design, from interface to output — that you can’t help but wonder how it clawed its way from the R&#x26;D lab. Out of the meetings. Away from the committees. How did it manage to maintain such clarity in its point of view?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Q — like most recent Leicas — is engraved with the softly geometric, proprietary LG 1050 typeface. It feels so, totally, completely at home, stamped into the camera body in all caps. It's highly legible and precisely designed. Minimal, functional, but with a bit of quirky character. Like the Q itself. This is the perfect camera typeface used in the perfect way. Mic dropped. Case closed.</p>\n</blockquote>",

      "content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Why-do-many-software-engineers-not-like-Java/answer/Michael-O-Church\">Michael O. Church</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>First, let's cover the technical issues. It's verbose, combines the worst of both worlds between static and dynamic typing by having a hobbled but extremely clunky type system, and mandates running on a virtual machine (VM) that has a macroscopic startup time (not an issue for long-running servers, but painful for command-line applications). […]</p>\n<p>The VM itself has a lot to recommend it. It offers concurrency and garbage collection at a level of quality that, until recently, wasn't found anywhere else. […] Much important software in the early 2000s was written in Java because, at the time, it was the best choice, even taking the mediocrity of the language itself into account. It had Unicode (albeit, UTF-16) from the start and a strong concurrency story, and it was a notch above C++ in terms of user experience. […]</p>\n<p>If you put Java on a technical trial, it doesn't do so bad. The <em>language</em> sucks, the platform is pretty good for most purposes. I do hate the dominant interpretation of \"object-oriented programming\" with a passion, because it objectively sucks. […]</p>\n<p>So let's talk about the political and cultural issues. First, the dominant Java culture is one of mediocrity and bad taste, with MetaModelVibratorVisitorFactory classes dominating. I've heard a number of experts on \"the Java issue\" argue that Java's biggest problem is the community, and that comes directly from the fact that good programmers don't want to deal with the bastardization of OOP that has entrenched itself in mainstream corporate development. You have a lot of people who trained up as \"Java programmers\", haven't seen a command line ever, and have no clue how the computer actually works. Most of them have never actually written a program; they just write classes and some Senior Chief Architect (who makes $246,001 per year and hasn't written a line of code since the 1990s) figures out how to stitch them together, and then tells some other clueless junior how to implement the glue in the gutshot hope that one will actually have the talent to make an actual working program out of the mess.</p>\n<p>This isn't inherent to the JVM, because Clojure (currently hosted on the JVM, although its endgame seems to be language-agnosticism) has a radically different (and better) community. Scala's community is more mixed, but the top Scala engineers (the ones making tools like Spark and Kestrel) are really fucking good.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>So, the short answer is: it's mostly not about the underlying platform (which is generally of high quality) and its only partly about the language (which is mediocre but can't be blamed directly for community problems). It goes a lot deeper than that, and not all of it is Java's fault. However, Java takes its share of the blame for its clear favoritism toward large programs (technically, established by its long startup time) and by its support of a very ugly (and counterproductive) variety of object-oriented programming.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Why-do-many-software-engineers-not-like-Java/answer/Stanley-Idesis\">Stanley Idesis</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’ve read the popular answers and will claim no contest to a majority of the complaints I found. […] However, here’s why I <em>love</em> it. […]</p>\n<p>In the Android world, developers use Java because they <em>have</em> to. However, much creativity has sprung from that limitation. People have written many excellent OS libraries in Java for Android. The platform continues to be a hotbed of Java activity which developers contribute to from all over the world. […]</p>\n<p>Android’s open nature, wide distribution, and powerful support from Google are almost enough to make Java hip again. […] Sure, some may argue that other runtimes and languages can enable the same capabilities of the device, but for whatever reason, Android chose Java.</p>\n<p>Until Google changes its mind, Java will remain relevant and the source of fascinating developments in the software community as long as Android remains popular.</p>\n</blockquote>",

It's in books, in movies, in games. In our collective mind, virtual reality is like flying cars: it's a dream that we always envisioned for our future as an high tech society.</p>\n<p>Well, we all remember that we didn't get flying cars for the new millenium.</p>\n<p>Incredible technologies portrayed in science-fiction books or movies are generally not really that relevant in reality. Or they are so hard to build that we can't even fathom to create them now. In our history, the way our society evolved was often very different to how we imagined it in our fictions. When you confront with the reality, many dreams are just what they are: dreams. I would need to dig up some sociology courses that I had—but I remember that this is a recurrent theme in our evolution.</p>\n<p>For VR, it's a bit different: we (almost) have the technology.

You're by definition not doing something incremental. There’s a lot of playful stuff going on. The probability of a good idea is pretty low.

      "content_html": "<p>Something I like in most modern programming languages is that they tend to ditch semicolons completely.</p>\n<p>Semicolons are a nuisance, a waste of time, a source of (easily fixable) errors, ugly and unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Compilers can easily work without them. Keeping them in old languages is, most of the time, simply a question of backward-compatibility.</p>\n<p>And that's fine, after all. In modern languages though, this is something that must be avoided. It's wrong and useless.</p>\n<p>Consider this snippet of Swift:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"swift\"><pre class=\"language-swift\"><code class=\"language-swift\"><span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> greeting <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Hello!\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> name <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> optionalName <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    greeting <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Hello, <span class=\"token interpolation\"><span class=\"token delimiter variable\">\\(</span>name<span class=\"token delimiter variable\">)</span></span>\"</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p><strong>No semicolon.</strong> Great. Now, consider a similar snippet of Go:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"go\"><pre class=\"language-go\"><code class=\"language-go\"><span class=\"token keyword\">func</span> <span class=\"token function\">sqrt</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>x <span class=\"token builtin\">float64</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">string</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n\t<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> x <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n\t\t<span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token function\">sqrt</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token operator\">-</span>x<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"i\"</span>\n\t<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n\t<span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> fmt<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">Sprint</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>math<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">Sqrt</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>x<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>It's pretty nice, isn't it?</p>\n<p>Go <strong>does</strong> use semicolons in its grammar. However, it's the lexer's role to add them, not the developer. <a href=\"http://zachholman.com/posts/shit-work/\">Let the machines do the shit work.</a></p>\n<p>Here's the extract from <a href=\"https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#semicolons\">Effective Go</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Like C, Go's formal grammar uses semicolons to terminate statements, but unlike in C, those semicolons do not appear in the source. Instead the lexer uses a simple rule to insert semicolons automatically as it scans, so the input text is mostly free of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And unlike in an extremely <a href=\"http://blog.izs.me/post/2353458699/an-open-letter-to-javascript-leaders-regarding\">popular</a> <a href=\"http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2010/05/semicolons/\">language</a>, Go imposes some formatting rules to its programmers and nobody has a problem with <a href=\"http://inimino.org/~inimino/blog/javascript_semicolons\">ASI</a>.</p>\n<p>However, there's still one perfectly valid case where semicolons are not optional:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"go\"><pre class=\"language-go\"><code class=\"language-go\"><span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> v <span class=\"token operator\">:=</span> math<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">Pow</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>x<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> n<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> v <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span> limit <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n\t<span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> v\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Between <code class=\"language-text\">math.Pow(x, n)</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">v &lt; limit</code>, you will find a semicolon. Because the two statements are on the same line, the compiler needs a semicolon to know where to end a statement and start the next one.</p>\n<p>Basically, the rule is simple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not use a semicolon when a statement ends with a newline.</li>\n<li>Use a semicolon when a statement is followed by another statement on the same line.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's the basic consensus in new languages.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>So, here's my question: <strong>why don't we do the same thing with commas?!</strong></p>\n<p>Let's look at the following snippet of Swift:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"swift\"><pre class=\"language-swift\"><code class=\"language-swift\"><span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> test <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"a\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"b\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"c\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>As you can see, each value of the array is separated by a comma. Same rule as the semicolons: if you are on the same line, use a separator. <em>In this case, it's a comma instead of the semicolon because the semantic is different.</em> Fine.</p>\n<p>Now, let's look at the same snippet with a multi-lines notation — this example might seem contrived, but this kind of notation is clearer when the values are more complex and/or numerous:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"swift\"><pre class=\"language-swift\"><code class=\"language-swift\"><span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> example <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">\"a\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">\"b\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">\"c\"</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Wait. What. <strong>It's exactly like in the one-line declaration just above.</strong> Which is not surprising, because almost any language will do that.</p>\n<p>That's inconsistent though. For semicolons, we omit them when there's a newline, but here, for a comma, we do not.</p>\n<p>The correct syntax should be:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"swift\"><pre class=\"language-swift\"><code class=\"language-swift\"><span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> test <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">\"a\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">\"b\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">\"c\"</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Simpler, prettier. And it gives a few bonuses beyond the cosmetic aspect:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It's less error-prone.</li>\n<li>\n<p>It's more practical for versioning tool's diffs:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2015-09-27-diff.png\" alt=\"Diff\"></p>\n</li>\n<li>It's consistent with the semicolon behavior.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I would apply the same rule to functions definition, maps or anything which needs commas, like I wrote in this example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"swift\"><pre class=\"language-swift\"><code class=\"language-swift\"><span class=\"token comment\">// One-line, comma.</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">func</span> <span class=\"token function\">test</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>x<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">Int</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> y<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">Int</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">// Or:</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">// Multi-lines, no comma.</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">func</span> <span class=\"token function\">test</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n  x<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">Int</span>\n  y<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">Int</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>In Go, those notations are not frequent because the formatting rules are stricter. However, in a struct definition, you must write this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"go\"><pre class=\"language-go\"><code class=\"language-go\"><span class=\"token keyword\">type</span> Point <span class=\"token keyword\">struct</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  X <span class=\"token builtin\">int</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  Y <span class=\"token builtin\">int</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p><em>(Note the trailing comma on the last line.)</em></p>\n<p>It's better than what Swift does (at least, diffs are not impacted and you don't have to think to add or remove a comma — you just have to).</p>\n<p>But why did they choose to keep the commas? No comma at all would have been way better AND coherent with the semicolon rule.</p>\n<p>And you know what is even more inconsistent? This, which is perfectly valid Go code:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"go\"><pre class=\"language-go\"><code class=\"language-go\"><span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n  x <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n  y <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span>\n  z <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Yep, this time, there is nothing at all.</p>",

      "content_html": "<p>“<a href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/RyanClark/20150917/253842/What_Makes_an_Indie_Hit_How_to_Choose_the_Right_Design.php\">What Makes an Indie Hit?: How to Choose the Right Design</a>” by Ryan Clark (of <a href=\"http://necrodancer.com/\">Crypt of the NecroDancer</a>) is an interesting read:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In this industry it's difficult to go far without learning from others. But from whom should we learn? I think it is wisest to study developers who have been repeatedly successful. Each time a developer creates another successful game, it becomes less and less likely that their repeated successes have been due to luck. Only a minuscule fraction of indie games break even, so what are the odds of developers like Jamie Cheng, Edmund McMillen, and Cliff Harris stringing together a number of successful games? The odds are low. There must be something other than luck at work! So perhaps these folks (and many others like them!) are the ones you should be studying and listening to.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I generally agree with the article (read it!), but there is one point that bothers me.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you want people to remember your game, to talk about your game, to write articles about your game, etc, it needs to have a hook. Preferably multiple hooks!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ok. This is spot on. However, and while I think that innovative games are important and crucial to explore original ideas and designs, <strong>not every game can be a new experience.</strong></p>\n<p>We need fun and excellent games in existing genres. Having brilliant roguelike, RTS, shmup, point &#x26; click, you name it… is equally important. And in this case, how do you hook people?</p>\n<p>What we wanted to do with <a href=\"http://steredenn.pixelnest.io\">Steredenn</a> (my game) is an excellent shmup-roguelike. We don't want to reinvent a genre or to experiment. We just want to make a great, fun, polished and addictive game. That's all. There's a market for a game like that — but we struggle to stand out of the crowd (and we tried many things like articles, arcade cabinet, tutorials, shows, devblog, contacts, press, etc.).</p>\n<p>If we had followed the \"hooks rule\", we would never have made Steredenn.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> But I truly think there's a place and an audience for this kind of games.</p>\n<p><strong>tl;dr: Should every game have a hook, a \"gimmick\", a unique twist? I don't think so.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>To be fair, I want to discuss of something else:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are unsure of the strength of your game's hooks, test them! With NecroDancer we did this by putting out a very early teaser trailer, and by demoing at PAX.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"Demoing at PAX\" is not something that everyone can afford. I'm all for the \"try your game in real as soon as possible\" mantra, but going to a big show is out of scope for almost any indie. It costs a lot just to present your game — and I don't even count the transportation, the food and hostels.</p>\n<p>When we went to Rezzed, we spent about £2000. It was close to us so the travel was very cheap.<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> Rezzed is also no PAX or Gamescon.</p>\n<p>With our finances, we can afford one or two big exhibitions a year, if we are lucky. I don't think we are the only one in this position. I even think that we are in a privileged situation compared to many indies.</p>\n<p>I don't want to fool myself: big shows are very important to get feedbacks, coverage and press. And this is something that many indies can't do at all. Languages, geography, finances — this is not an easy problem.</p>\n<p>And as Ryan tells us a little bit later:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is common these days for devs to downplay the importance of festivals, awards, and even of press. I disagree. Sure, accolades and reviews themselves may not drive mountains of sales, but most people need to hear about your game from numerous sources before they'll actually watch a trailer or buy the game.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Exactly. :)</p>\n<p>To Ryan's credit, he's also ending his article with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I know how difficult it is to succeed as a new indie dev, and I am aware of the advantages that I have due to experience, connections, and reputation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thanks for the tips, anyways!</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>Well, we do try a few novel ideas in Steredenn, so it's not a pure \"plain-old-game\". But the essence of the game is a direct action-packed game. That's our main focus.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>France to England.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

      "content_html": "<p><a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/24083/designer-diary-cruel-cruel-galaxy-or-designing-qua\">Fascinating post-mortem of Quantum, by its designer, Eric Zimmerman</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Quantum is a strategy game for two through four players that incorporates elements of tactics, resource management, and empire building. Players each begin the game with a small fleet of three starships on a customizable map built of modular tiles. Your goal is to expand by building Quantum Cubes on planets, along the way growing your fleet and evolving its abilities. […]</p>\n<p>Another element that opened up the possibilities of the game during this early prototyping period was the addition of special power cards. While I was working on it, I remember seeing a talk at the Game Developers Conference by Rob Pardo, one of the lead designers of World of Warcraft. According to Rob, one of the philosophies at his company Blizzard was to make the player feel overpowered. According to Rob, special abilities and power-ups should feel mighty and spectacular, rather than just being some kind of incremental stat improvement.</p>\n<p>As I started adding the advance cards to the game, I tried to have them embody this approach, especially when it came to the permanent card powers. My goal was that every card should feel incredibly powerful – a potential game winner in the right situation. I loved seeing my playtesters' faces grow greedy as they read the cards, astonished at how good the powers seemed to be.</p>\n<p>The challenge of powerful cards, of course, is balancing them. […]</p>\n<p>Designing the right mix of cards came down to good old-fashioned balancing and testing. There are a number of heuristics I tried to use in designing the cards to be balanced. For example, no card simply gives players an extra fourth action each turn; instead, some cards give you an extra action, but that action is limited, such as a free move that is only one space. There are also cards that do give you a completely open-ended extra action, but only if certain conditions are met, such as if you have more ships on the map than any other player. […]</p>\n<p> It seemed hopeless; I had designed a game with a combat system that no one wanted to use! The solution to this problem was to directly link combat to winning the game. […]</p>\n<p>One strong focus of our work was the language of Quantum: the terms in the rules, the names of the cards and units, and the other words we used in the game. In early prototypes, the titles of the advance cards were more technological: \"Ferocious\", the card that gives you a combat bonus, was originally called \"Armor\", while \"Energetic\", which gives you a movement bonus, was titled \"Propulsion\".</p>\n<p>The names of the card were clear, but they felt generic. Thinking about how to emphasize the player-as-commander, I changed the names from nouns to adjectives. Rather than describing the player's fleet, the cards now described the player. Instead of \"Fuel\", \"Evasion\", and \"Engineering\", the cards now had names like \"Brilliant\", \"Cruel\", and \"Stubborn\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.funforge.fr/US/?portfolio=quantum\">Quantum</a> is one of the best boardgames I recently played. It was unavailable for a year but I finally got my hand on the re-edition. The post-mortem shows all the history behind the game and how some concepts were found and implemented.</p>\n<p>The game is really fast, complex and deep. There's a bit of chance in the game through the roll of the dices (<em>obviously</em>), but I don't think it matters that much in the end. Your decisions are way more important than your luck.</p>",

As a starting point, I often like to think of the rule of two with things that you have around the house. So, for example, if you have one roll of toilet paper, you really don't have any toilet paper. Because when that one runs out, you're in trouble. So you really need two rolls of toilet paper at all time. It's a redundancy rule, basically. It's where this comes from. […]</p>\n<p>This is one of my little pieces of advice for trying to run a life very smoothly. It's that, everything that you can possibly have two of, you should have it. Two shampoo bottles, two bottles of vitamins, two boxes of cereal, two cartons of eggs. You want duplicates of everything. And then, when you're down to one of those things, that's the sign that you need to buy the next one. In this way, you are never out, you're never out of anything. […]</p>\n<p>It's applicable to everything in your whole life, everything that's important.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><small>(Emphasis mine)</small></p>\n<p>This is so spot on.

Here it is.</p>\n<p>Grey continues:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"transcript\">\n<p>Think this way with computer files: you have only one copy of that file, guess what? You have no copy of this file. I even think it's applicable to work. If you have one source of income, in many ways, it's like you have no source of income. Because if something happens with your main job, you are in lots and lots of trouble. One source of income, no source of income.</p>\n</blockquote>",

      "content_html": "<p><a href=\"http://perl.plover.com/yak/12views/samples/notes.html\">Twelve Views of Mark Jason Dominus</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I released the Text::Template module several years ago, and it was immediately very successful. It's small, simple, fast, and it does a lot of things well. At the time, there were not yet 29 templating systems available on CPAN.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the module quickly stabilized. I would get bug reports, and they would turn out to be bugs in the module's users, not in the module; I would get feature requests, and usually it turned out that what the requester wanted was possible, or even easy, without any changes to the module. Since the module was perfect, there was no need to upload new versions of it to CPAN.</p>\n<p>But then I started to get disturbing emails. \"Hi, I notice you have not updated Text::Template for nine months. Are you still maintaining it?\" \"Hi, I notice you seem to have stopped work on Text::Template. Have you decided to abandon this approach?\" \"Hi, I was thinking of using Text::Template, but I saw it wasn't being maintained any more, so I decided to use Junk::CrappyTemplate, because I need wanted to be sure of getting support for it.\"</p>\n<p>I started wondering if maybe the thing to do was to release a new version of Text::Template every month, with no changes, but with an incremented version number. Of course, that's ridiculous. But it seems that people assume that if you don't update the module every month, it must be dead. People seem to think that all software requires new features or frequent bug fixes. Apparently, the idea of software that doesn't get updated because it's finished is inconceivable.</p>\n<p>I blame Microsoft.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I must confess that I tend to look at the date of the last commit when I choose a library over another (along with other metrics, hopefully).</p>\n<p>Well, I also think that a \"perfect library\" might not exist, but the author is making a really good point in his talk.</p>\n<p>(via <a href=\"http://www.drmaciver.com/2015/08/what-if-we-had-more-finished-libraries/\">What if we had more finished libraries?</a>)</p>",

      "content_html": "<p>Like almost everyone else, I don't like ads. Nevertheless, I don't use an ad-blocker either.</p>\n<p>Using the web and using an ad-blocker is hypocrite. Like it or not, it's the most widely used business model on the web. That's how most people get paid for the content you read, watch and listen <strong>for free</strong>.</p>\n<p>There're other ways to do it (affiliate links, feed sponsorships, paywalls, etc.), but the dominant model today is ads.</p>\n<p>You know what? I don't find ads particularly irritating from now on. Why? Because I find and read honest websites that respect me by not throwing huge walls of ads to my face. I avoid those ad-filled websites, because most of the time, they are simply bad. And for YouTube? I patiently wait because the great contents made there that I want to see deserve to be paid.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>The solution is not ad-blocking. The solution is to find well-made contents which focus on the readership, not the publisher.<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Let me finish with <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9695552\">this</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a huge irony in that fact that AdBlock's function of keeping ads away from our content will eventually do the opposite. The alternative to ads alongside my content is ads inside my content.</p>\n<p>Let's face it: paywalls don't work. The alternative on the horizon is native advertising. Buzzfeed is now famously refusing to host ads. Instead they sustain themselves by publishing content that subtly supports the agenda of any company with deep enough pockets to pay for it. A viewer's ability to distinguish between native ads and regular articles is small and quickly vanishing. If separate ads stop reaching people, the path to monetization remaining is to change your content to reflect someone else's agenda.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because you cannot distinguish an ad from an article, it's even more insidious and dishonest. And this time, you won't be able to block it.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Update <span class=\"more\">08 June 2018</span></h2>\n<p>My view on this has changed quite a bit recently. With the explosion of ad tracking technologies and the bloat they add to any webpage, I <em>do use</em> an ad blocker now. But only with Safari, where I find it safe to use an extension like that thanks to its \"Content Blocker\" model of security (ie., no access to the page content, just many rules that match the webpage without a way to send data back).</p>\n<p>I have absolutely no trust in a company like AdBlock, and I am not willing to give them my data so easily.</p>\n<p>I do, however, unblock some specific sites. It's a shame, though.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>Ads in apps?

      "title": "Force Touch Affordance",
      "content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/watch/technology/#sensitive\">Force Touch</a> is an impressive piece of technology. It currently equips the Apple Watch and the new Macbooks. You press firmly on the screen and the haptic engine will register a \"deep\" press.</p>\n<p>On the Watch, I found that the feedback was not properly mapped to the press (it's a tap on your wrist, not on your finger). I didn't use the Watch a lot, but I've also found that it was sometime hard to trigger.</p>\n<p>On the new Macbooks' trackpad, the feeling is fantastic. You can push multiple times and sense the force you apply like it's real. You may not even understand that it's not a true physical button.</p>\n<p>But… <strong>Force Touch is not discoverable.</strong></p>\n<p>There is no visual clue that Force Touch is available — either on the screen or on a specific control. It's like the menu button of the old Android versions: you tap somewhere (the menu button on Android, firmly with Force Touch) and something may happen. Or not. It's confusing and it's one more hidden gesture with no affordance. It's no better than a long press if its sole purpose is to be another context menu.</p>\n<p>Indeed, on the Apple Watch, Force Touch's goal is to show a secret menu with additional actions. I understand the purpose — the screen is small and you can't fit everything on the screen. But this exact same behavior on a bigger display will have the same problem that Android had with its menu button. It's even worse than a hamburger menu, because the icon won't be there to tell you that an additional layer is present.</p>\n<p>On OS X, I found that the usage of Force Touch is better: it's not a way to show secondary actions, but just a \"deeper version\" of an action. In QuickTime, for example, you press firmly on the forward button and the video will fast forward faster for each level you reach. It's still hard to know when it's available and might result in nothing, but at least, it's consistant with its source.</p>",

Spoilers ahead.</strong><br><br></p>\n<p>Well. I didn't <strong>love</strong> the movie (the pace is really <strong>slow</strong>, even for a movie from the sixties, and not being a fan of classical scores might not have helped). I don't mind if a film is ambiguous or doesn't explain much, but 2001 may have gone a bit too far.</p>\n<p>I get that the monoliths are alien artifacts (or an alien race). I get that David Bowman has been translated in a sort of zoo. I vaguely understood that the Star Gate is a kind of allegory about the human reproduction (there's even a foetus and an umbilical cord during this passage — and the Star Child coming back to earth can also be seen as a birth). But why? Why does an extraterrestrial race would want to improve another race? Why use monoliths? Why would they open the gate near Jupiter and not on the moon?</p>\n<p>The HAL sequence was perfectly clear however, even if they don't explain why it was malfunctioning (it doesn't matter). An interpretation talks about the duality between being a perfect computer and having to lie to the crew about the origin of the mission — this would create a paradox inside the machine. I like that idea.</p>\n<p>What, in the end, annoyed me the most were the expections I had. I always thought that the story would be phenomenal. And… it's not, really. It's pretty simple as soon as you think about it (not having explanations don't change that fact — it just wraps the movie in more mysteries). I had the same reaction after finishing Blade Runner, a few years ago.</p>\n<p>It's not the movie's fault: every awesome idea it invented has been reused everywhere since.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie does not feel that dated: the images are still beautiful and the depiction of space is really well-done (especially for its time).</p>\n<p>What I loved about the movie is some of the possible interpretations. I'm really eager to read the novel by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_%28novel%29\">Arthur C. Clarke</a> to dive a bit more into the story. Especially for this theory:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Arthur C. Clarke's theory of the future symbiosis of man and machine, expanded by Kubrick into what Wheat calls \"a spoofy three-evolutionary leaps scenario\": ape to man, an abortive leap from man to machine, and a final, successful leap from man to 'Star Child'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've also found a great quote by Stanley Kubrick about intelligent life when <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_2001:_A_Space_Odyssey\">I was reading articles about the movie</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will say that the God concept is at the heart of 2001 but not any traditional, anthropomorphic image of God.</p>\n<p>I don't believe in any of Earth's monotheistic religions, but I do believe that one can construct an intriguing scientific definition of God, once you accept the fact that there are approximately 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone, that each star is a life-giving sun and that there are approximately 100 billion galaxies in just the visible universe. Given a planet in a stable orbit, not too hot and not too cold, and given a few billion years of chance chemical reactions created by the interaction of a sun's energy on the planet's chemicals, it's fairly certain that life in one form or another will eventually emerge.</p>\n<p>It's reasonable to assume that there must be, in fact, countless billions of such planets where biological life has arisen, and the odds of some proportion of such life developing intelligence are high.</p>\n<p>Now, the sun is by no means an old star, and its planets are mere children in cosmic age, so it seems likely that there are billions of planets in the universe not only where intelligent life is on a lower scale than man but other billions where it is approximately equal and others still where it is hundreds of thousands of millions of years in advance of us.</p>\n<p>When you think of the giant technological strides that man has made in a few millennia—less than a microsecond in the chronology of the universe—can you imagine the evolutionary development that much older life forms have taken? They may have progressed from biological species, which are fragile shells for the mind at best, into immortal machine entities—and then, over innumerable eons, they could emerge from the chrysalis of matter transformed into beings of pure energy and spirit.</p>\n<p>Their potentialities would be limitless and their intelligence ungraspable by humans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>It was one of the greatest shame of my movie culture.

      "content_html": "<p>For a few reasons, I'm considering whether or not I should be buying an Apple Watch.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>For many people I know, it's another useless gadget.</p>\n<p>That's fine: most people are sceptical about new technologies, after all. It's in our nature: human doesn't like change (and new things) until it reaches a certain threshold and becomes acceptable. And to be fair, it might just be a fad.</p>\n<p>The iPhone (and other touch-based smartphones) were also considered as useless gadgets in their beginnings too — almost everybody has a smartphone now, right?<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>But like the iPhone, there's a chance the Apple Watch will succeed and become a thing (that's a big if, but I'm still more inclined to believe it will than not).</p>\n<p><strong>For the moment, I don't think there're many usages that make a watch (or other wearable devices) truly better than a phone</strong>. Hopefully, we are only at the beginning. To understand what we can do as developers, we have to use those objects daily.</p>\n<p>That's not to say they are completely useless as of today.</p>\n<p>The usages that intrigue me the most are:<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maps navigation (\"quick glance, straight on, a few haptic taps, go right — bam — you're arrived!\").</li>\n<li>Services like Capitaine Train <a href=\"https://blog.capitainetrain.com/8788-apple-watch\">(with an awesome watch app design that clearly understands its support and context)</a>.</li>\n<li>Passbooks and Apple Pay (if it ever comes to France).</li>\n<li>Music and podcasts playback (with Overcast or a remote).</li>\n<li>Fitness and health.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>But not notifications.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>I'm a huge proponent of disabling almost all notifications.</p>\n<p>I restrict the apps that can send notifications to the bare minimum (SMS, calendar, reminders and that's most of it) because I think that notifications are a nuisance.</p>\n<p>You don't need to know when someone followed you on Instagram or Twitter. You don't need to be interrupted when you receive a mail. That's also why I'm even more aggresive against sound for notifications (I do receive my mail every hour, but <em>silently</em>). I'd rather grab my phone and act willingly on something than being always distracted.</p>\n<p>People who are flooded by notifications (like <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/a/apple-watch-review\">tech reviewers</a>) and criticize a device because of that ARE the issue, not the device. A wearable will only make their problem worse, because they will also allow access to those nuisance to a device that is physically connected to their body. And which can tap them <strong>anytime</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>What is really making sense is to have quick pertinent contextual information available at a glance.</p>\n<p>Like, when your train is ready to leave — which platform, what seat? That's useful: you are in a urge, you walk quickly and taking your phone out of your pocket takes time and precision.</p>\n<p>Having your itinerary directions given <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/04/23/apple-watch-user-guide\">to you by a few vibrations</a>? That's great too.</p>\n<p>Having a full-fledged Twitter app on your wrist? Useless. Getting your Facebook likes instantly? Useless.<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup></p>\n<br>\n<p>I'm interested in wearables (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/glass/\">when they are not socially awkward</a>) because of what they might become. What they are today is just a glimpse of the potential of such devices.</p>\n<p>Imagine the application in the health field: with sensors on your body, it could be really easy to know and track diseases.

Origami Live is a new app that lets you use your Origami prototypes on your iPhone or iPad. Alongside it, we’re releasing Origami 2.0, which has a ton of new features, including code exporting, powerful gesture support, Sketch integration, presentation mode, and more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've watched the new video tutorials on the site and tested <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/id942636206\">Origami Live</a> (a companion app that displays your prototype right on your phone). It worked flawlessly and the results were impressive. The app is smooth and perfectly synchronized with the desktop viewer.</p>\n<p>I didn't try the Sketch integration, but if it works as advertised, that's a big win for my workflow.</p>\n<p>They have also added a ton of new shortcuts to speed-up the app. Like if you press <code class=\"language-text\">t</code> between two nodes (when hovering on the output or input of a node), Origami will automatically insert a <code class=\"language-text\">transition</code> node between them:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2015-02-25-origami-shortcut.gif\" alt=\"Origami new shortcuts\"></p>\n<p>There's a lot more that you can learn by <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/origami/tutorials/\">watching the videos</a> or <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/origami/documentation/concepts/KeyboardShortcuts.html\">reading the full list of shortcuts</a>. The documentation is much more complete than when I tried Origami last year. At the time, it was really difficult to get into it. It looks way easier now.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/origami/\">download Origami here</a> (it requires Quartz Composer).</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you are interested in Quartz Composer &#x26; Origami, there's also a plugin named <a href=\"https://labs.ideo.com/2014/05/27/avocado/\">\"Avocado\"</a> that enhances Origami.

We discuss the process of designing developing Threes, and what goes in to making a great little puzzle game. We then talk about the whimsical minimalism that works so well in indie games, and how to bring them to life. We talk about difficulty, complexity, and how to tune games. We touch on the effects of free to play on puzzle games, and how it makes us feel weird.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There're some great points in there. It focuses a lot on Threes' gameplay and evolutions and dives a bit more into minimalism in games.</p>",

It's dead simple, but <strong>it works</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>NB: this advice is especially true for self-employed people (because you can't take a break with your coworkers), but anybody working at a desk for several hours should do it.

[…]</p>\n<p>Using large teams of people specially trained to watch movies, Netflix deconstructed Hollywood. They paid people to watch films and tag them with all kinds of metadata. This process is so sophisticated and precise that taggers receive a 36-page training document that teaches them how to rate movies on their sexually suggestive content, goriness, romance levels, and even narrative elements like plot conclusiveness. […]</p>\n<p>The Netflix Quantum Theory doc spelled out ways of tagging movie endings, the \"social acceptability\" of lead characters, and dozens of other facets of a movie. Many values are \"scalar,\" that is to say, they go from 1 to 5. So, every movie gets a romance rating, not just the ones labeled \"romantic\" in the personalized genres. Every movie's ending is rated from happy to sad, passing through ambiguous. Every plot is tagged. Lead characters' jobs are tagged. Movie locations are tagged. Everything. Everyone.</p>\n<p>That's the data at the base of the pyramid. It is the basis for creating all the altgenres that I scraped. Netflix's engineers took the microtags and created a syntax for the genres, much of which we were able to reproduce in our generator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><small>(Emphasis mine)</small></p>\n<p>This article completely blew my mind. Great journalism.</p>\n<p>The idea to tag any movie that much and create ultra-specific subgenres is so clever. Hell of a work too.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Concerning the <em>Perry Mason</em> mystery, I found an interesting <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/#comment-1184453715\">explanation</a> in the comments (yep):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Actually, Alexis, I am baffled by your conclusion that the Perry Mason Mystery is a \"ghost in the machine\".</p>\n<p>To me it seems obvious: there is a subgenre, \"Understated Cerebral Mysteries with Ironclad Plots, Good Dialogue, Not Much Action or Romance, and on the Side of the Defense\", that is popular with viewers yet <em>drastically</em> underpopulated. It's so drastically underpopulated that the show that's a best-fit for the category is <em>enormously</em> popular, much more popular than anyone realized.</p>\n<p>Far from being a \"bug\", this is programming <em>platinum</em> for Netflix. If they're as smart as I think they are, this is the subgenre where they should be looking to make a TV series. The biggest problem will be finding a showrunner and scriptwriters who are able to go against so many of Hollywood's cliches and assumptions. They need to make something where what is visually interesting, striking, or exciting is unimportant, but where there are no holes in the plots. Very high degree of difficulty, and only profitable to Netflix, which makes money from its shows, not from the advertising.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sounds a bit like <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1475582/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\">Sherlock</a>, no?</p>",

      "content_html": "<p>Better late than never; I've managed to watch “<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/68470326\">How Designers Destroyed The World</a>” by Mike Monteiro.</p>\n<p>It's a great talk except that I'm not fond of the tone. Though it fits well with the content, I find it a bit overdramatic. The end is also a tad lengthy, which is unfortunate.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, I liked what I heard. <em>Which makes me consider…</em></p>\n<p>Regularly, I find myself stuck with incredibly ill-conceived things that frustrate me. These objects, rules or designs are things as simple as an ATM, a software or a door. They make us loose time, or worse, do (severe) mistakes.</p>\n<p>For example: there is a crossroad near my parents house. A few years ago, the mayor decided to remove the road signs at this place AND to not replace it. In France, there is an implicit rule which states that when there are no signs, you have to let the cars at your right cross the junction first. This rule is stupid. <strong>When you drive, you have no time to doubt</strong>. A sign serves primarily as way to convey a danger or a rule, without making you think. You know what you have to do instantly. <em>If you see a stop sign, you stop</em>. That is all.</p>\n<p>This implicit rule makes us do the contrary. At a junction like the one I talked about before, you see nothing, so you have to think, analyze and react. It's easy to have a (minor) car accident there. Moreover, people of my town had used this junction for years, knowing precisely how to react. But now, the priority rule has changed, and it's a mess. The result? In the best case, everybody stop, wait for 10 seconds to analyze the place and then drive.</p>\n<p><strong>This is a result of a design decision. Someone decided to do that.</strong> In this case, someone decided to break something that worked well for all this time.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, it might just be a dumb design that put you in an embarrassing situation. If you are a man, just remember the last time you have used a flat and too-high urinal. :)</p>\n<p>When I talk about that with some of my friends, they think that I'm excessively demanding and that the problem is me. Perhaps.</p>\n<p>I will conclude with a quote from the talk:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"transcript\">\n<p>There are professions more harmful than (industrial) design, <strong>but only a very few of them.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>",

We pour all our creativity, time, and passion into creating basically worthless products.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Recent events and the backlash <a href=\"http://realmacsoftware.com/blog/some-changes-for-clear\">against Realmac with Clear for iOS 7</a> are sad.</p>\n<p>People don't understand that creating softwares — <strong>truly</strong> good softwares that sweat every detail — takes a lot of time and money. Ironically, even a lot of developers who work in big companies don't want to pay for softwares.</p>\n<p>The mobile apps markets have made this situation worse.</p>\n<p>I'm currently thinking back about the mobile market, especially for games. At a time, I thought that going mobile-only was the best shot today, but the more I think about it, the more I'm realizing that a platform like Steam (which also drives the prices to the bottom, alas) is more sustainable for a developer/company.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.marco.org/2013/09/28/underscore-price-dynamics\">Marco Arment</a> said in its latest blog post: <em>\"Paid-up-front iOS apps had a great run, but it’s over. Time to make other plans.\"</em>.</p>\n<p>So what does that leave? Freemium? Unfortunately, freemium almost always goes with <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/candy-crush-saga/id553834731?mt=8\">bad apps or games that trick users to pay for more</a>.</p>\n<p>N.B.: To be clear, as a user, I'm happy to <em>pay less</em>. For almost everybody, a software or a game at 50-100$ is way too high, and that's fine. What I don't like is that we are now in a situation where  even one buck for an app you use daily is too much. <strong>One buck per app cannot sustain a one-person business.</strong></p>",

I am not writing about brand design, but about brand management. This is about a simple rule: Brand design follows brand management, not the other way around.</p>\n<p>One could argue that we can’t say if this is bad brand management. Unless we know what the brand ambition, the brand architecture, and the brand strategy is, we ought to have no opinion. Maybe the logo does exactly what it is supposed to do. Because really, it doesn’t matter whether it looks pretty, or whether someone likes or dislikes the purple or the scallops. The Coca-Cola logo was not designed by a professional designer, it is typographically hideous, but that doesn’t matter. Brand identity is not about visual refinement or aesthetics. It can be purposely ugly, like the London Olympics logo. What is important is that it is done seriously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Personally, I don't care about Yahoo's new logo. Anything would be better off that the old one.</p>\n<p>By the way, I'm still amazed by the quality of the iA website, and especially the blog. Typography, details, everything. It's wonderful.</p>",

Nowadays, there is three iPhones available: the flagship — the iPhone 5 —, and the older and (slightly) cheaper iPhone 4S and 4.</p>\n<p>By releasing the 5C, Apple can get rid of the iPhone 4 and 4S once and for all. It means that there will be only the iPhone 5C, the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 5S. Doing that was probably not possible for Apple before, without compromising the quality of the cheapest model and at the scale at which Apple operates.</p>\n<p>We can infer (if the rumors are true) that Apple has now the production lines to release two new iPhones at the same time.</p>\n<p>This has a big impact: In the fall, all the iPhones sold are going to be capable of using <strong>every</strong> features of the last OS. It's huge. For example, iOS 7 AirDrop only works on one current model: the iPhone 5.<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can put the iPhone way ahead of its competitors that struggle with OSes versions and hardware disparities.</li>\n<li>It will also unify the lineup around the new lightning connector and the 4 inches screen.</li>\n<li>It implies that the hardware and the software are going to evolve at the same pace.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The story is the same with the iPads. I am almost certain that the iPad 2 will disappear this year, leaving only the new Mini and classic iPads available.</p>\n<p>The next year eventual iPhone five inches will fit perfectly in this new strategy: selling only renewed devices with state of the art hardware and software.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: Related, \"<a href=\"http://furbo.org/2013/08/15/its-the-production-line-stupid/\">It’s the Production Line, Stupid</a>\".</p>\n<p><strong>Update 09/12/2013</strong>: Guess I was wrong.

Motion can provide so much information! Maybe the tools to create prototypes are too complicated for most designers?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is something I always speak about: an interface without motion is nothing. There is no context, no link between different objects.</p>\n<p>Windows Phone did a great job to this regard. For example, if you tap a tile on the homescreen, the rest of them move outside the screen before the one you pushed. The system has clearly been created around that, to respond to inputs and act on them.</p>\n<p>Motion is clearly a thing that designers tend to forget. Even if an interface is beautiful, it will look dull if nothing reacts to you. The \"<em>flat</em>\" design movement will exacerbate this. iOS 7 has made depth and context keys citizens of its new UX paradigm.</p>\n<p>Tools to simplify this process are now crucial.</p>",

I highly recommend to check everything he has done. You will not loose your time.</p>\n<p>One of the moments I liked the best is when Brett Victor is talking about smalltalk and its browser view. This idea, that is fairly old now, reminds me of some initiatives like <a href=\"http://brackets.io/\">Brackets</a> or <a href=\"http://www.lighttable.com/\">Light Table</a>. These editors are still using text files to manage code, but they add inline code browsing or live feedback, amongst others. It is funny to see that we had to wait 40 years to see that happens.</p>\n<p>Which reminds me of the conclusion of Brett Victor: <strong>you have to realize that you do not know what you are doing in order to find new way of doing things</strong>.</p>\n<p>In the programming field, we have improved our tools, but globally, we are still doing the same thing: coding with text files. <em>That's sad</em>.</p>\n<h2>A brief aside</h2>\n<p>A theme that comes in almost all the Brett Victor's talks is live feedback. Just watch <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/36579366\">Inventing on Principle</a>.</p>\n<p>I have used Interface Builder a lot recently — a software to create interface for iOS apps —, and even if this tool is one of the best of its kind (I look at you Android, with your stupid XML UI files), it is not a good one for all that.</p>\n<p>It gives me a partial representation of my interface: I cannot do everything with it. I cannot see animations. I cannot see particles. I cannot test the physic (and physic is clearly one of the key points of the new iOS 7 interface). I loose a lot of time checking that what I have done in code and Interface Builder are really what I want. It is tedious. It is slow.</p>\n<p>We need better tools to create UI — we need <strong>feedback and interactivity</strong> directly within the creative process.</p>",

It's a technical detail, not something that has any value for a consumer.</li>\n<li>Firefox means a slow and heavy browser. The phone costs $69, which will probably result in a crappy hardware. The web (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) is a nice environment, a really powerful one to create websites, but it is <em>slow</em>. I want my phone to run quickly and smoothly.

This phone (Firefox + crappy hardware + web) sounds <em>not</em> like a good deal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would like to be wrong, but I don't expect much and I don't see the value of Firefox OS, especially against its main competitor — Android.
