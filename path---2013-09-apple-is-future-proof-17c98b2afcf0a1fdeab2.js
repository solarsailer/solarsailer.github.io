The use of the M7 motion co-processor or the 64-bits iOS are even less tangible. Unless you are Apple and you know what will be released next.</p>\n<p>They are calmly preparing the ground for the shape of things to come. <em>It\'s thrilling.</em></p>\n<p><br>N.B.: The Bluetooth LE technology that was embedded a few years ago was exactly that: at that time, it was useless, but in the context of a wearable Apple watch, it makes a <strong>lot</strong> of sense.</p>',frontmatter:{date:"2013-09-16",readableDate:"16 September 2013",title:"Apple is future proof",showPageTitle:null},fields:{path:"/2013/09/apple-is-future-proof/"}}},pathContext:{id:"/Users/ashen/Code/solarsailer.net/content/posts/2013-09-16-apple-is-future-proof.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
