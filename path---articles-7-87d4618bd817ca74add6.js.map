There is no context, no link between different objects.</p>\\n<p>Windows Phone did a great job to this regard. For example, if you tap a tile on the homescreen, the rest of them move outside the screen before the one you pushed. The system has clearly been created around that, to respond to inputs and act on them.</p>\\n<p>Motion is clearly a thing that designers tend to forget.

There is no context, no link between different objects.</p>\\n<p>Windows Phone did a great job to this regard. For example, if you tap a tile on the homescreen, the rest of them move outside the screen before the one you pushed. The system has clearly been created around that, to respond to inputs and act on them.</p>\\n<p>Motion is clearly a thing that designers tend to forget. Even if an interface is beautiful, it will look dull if nothing reacts to you. The \\\"<em>flat</em>\\\" design movement will exacerbate this. iOS 7 has made depth and context keys citizens of its new UX paradigm.</p>\\n<p>Tools to simplify this process are now crucial.</p>\"}},{\"node\":{\"id\":\"/Users/ashen/Code/solarsailer.net/content/posts/2013-08-13-marketers.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":null,\"title\":\"Marketers\",\"date\":\"2013-08-13\",\"readableDate\":\"13 August 2013\",\"redirectFrom\":null,\"excerpt\":null,\"excerptQuote\":{\"name\":\"Rian Van Der Merwe\",\"quote\":\"The problem with many Marketers today is that they too often make it all about the company, and not about user needs.\"}},\"fields\":{\"path\":\"/2013/08/marketers/\",\"slug\":\"/2013/08/marketers/\"},\"html\":\"<p><a href=\\\"http://www.elezea.com/2013/07/hey-marketers/\\\">Hey Marketers, making a website is not about you</a> (emphasis mine):</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The problem with many Marketers today is that they too often make it all about the company, and not about user needs.
