I am not writing about brand design, but about brand management. This is about a simple rule: Brand design follows brand management, not the other way around.</p>\n<p>One could argue that we can’t say if this is bad brand management. Unless we know what the brand ambition, the brand architecture, and the brand strategy is, we ought to have no opinion. Maybe the logo does exactly what it is supposed to do. Because really, it doesn’t matter whether it looks pretty, or whether someone likes or dislikes the purple or the scallops. The Coca-Cola logo was not designed by a professional designer, it is typographically hideous, but that doesn’t matter. Brand identity is not about visual refinement or aesthetics. It can be purposely ugly, like the London Olympics logo. What is important is that it is done seriously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Personally, I don't care about Yahoo's new logo. Anything would be better off that the old one.</p>\n<p>By the way, I'm still amazed by the quality of the iA website, and especially the blog. Typography, details, everything. It's wonderful.</p>",frontmatter:{date:"2013-09-11",readableDate:"11 September 2013",title:"Brand and logo",showPageTitle:null},fields:{path:"/2013/09/brand-and-logo/"}}},pathContext:{id:"/Users/ashen/Code/solarsailer.net/content/posts/2013-09-11-brand-and-logo.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
