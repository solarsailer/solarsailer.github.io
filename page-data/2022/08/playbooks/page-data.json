When I see a process like this, instead of either doing nothing or just diving in and writing some code, I’ll first write a playbook. A playbook is nothing more than a set of instructions for performing the task – a “recipe” if you will. The key is to be as specific as possible. If this is some sort of task that involves code, you can even include bits of code or shell commands that someone following the playbook could copy and paste.</p>\n<p><strong>This gets a few steps closer to the goals of automation – consistency, repeatability, reliability – at a fraction of the effort</strong>. And, if you later decide that automation is worth the effort, the playbook serves as a detailed specification for your code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><small>(Emphasis mine)</small></p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>Context.</p>\n<p>  It might be one of the words I use the most nowadays. <em>\"Always give the context\", \"Start with context\", \"Can you give me the context again?\".</em></p>\n<p>  Why? Because not having the context is like shooting in the dark. You can perform your task, but it will likely be wrong because you don't understand everything around it.
