[…]</p>\n<p>I often think about the benefits of automation in the context of time savings. It makes things more efficient, removes drudgery. But I’ve realized over time that the <em>real</em> benefit of automation is avoiding mistakes.</p>\n<p>When I automate something (anything), I’m defining the steps that need to be included to complete the task. I’m no longer relying on my memory to ensure that every step is complete or the specific ways in which a step should be completed. This is especially useful if it’s something I don’t do very often […] if it helps me do the exact same thing one time a year later, that’s often worth as much as any amount of total time saved in my life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Exactly!</strong> Avoiding mistakes is much more important than any time saving<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>. Automation removes the need to remember what you need to do, and simplify the sharing of knowledge. It's basically a <em>self-fulfilling <a href=\"http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/\">checklist</a></em> that can be triggered by anybody.</p>\n<p>Let me digress a bit…</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When I was creating a new website for <a href=\"https://pixelnest.io/\">Pixelnest Studio</a>, the first step I was doing was setuping the project, and automating the deployment, so that I could come back 6 months later and still be able to deploy easily without reading the README or the code.</p>\n<p>For <a href=\"http://steredenn.pixelnest.io\">Steredenn</a>, I created a lot of scripts to automate the release pipeline (building the game, packaging it, creating the different changelogs for the multiple platforms, etc.). This took me a non-negligible amount of time, but when I needed to do a new release after a long hiatus, it was a breeze and such a relief. Bonus: my associate could also do it in case I was not here, without having to dive in the code or knowing the full process.<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> In the game itself, <a href=\"https://dmayance.com/\">Damien</a> spent time creating little tools and helpers to go to a specific part of the game easily, so we could test different configurations and situations at will. The result? A more stable game.</p>\n<p>I maintain a personal repository of <a href=\"https://github.com/solarsailer/dotfiles/\">most of my scripts</a> on GitHub, and one of most treasured part is a procedure to boostrap a new macOS installation in a semi-automated fashion. I don't do that often, but I know that I can confidently reproduce a new environment (in case of loss or theft) without a lot of struggle.</p>\n<p>I tried to put most of the settings of my apps (Alfred, iTerm2, Dash, etc.) on a cloud provider, so that I can share them between computers and have a backup. The tools are tailored to my use, and I don't have to customize them again.</p>\n<p>I automated our servers installation so that I could nuke them and reinstantiate them easily. I had a doubt about something I did? No worry, let's just start from the beginning.</p>\n<p>It's not pure automation, but it falls in the same ballpark for me. It's emptying your brain so that you can focus on what you care. <em>And, bonus, it's fun to do!</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>That's also a reason why I love checklists so much. Checklists are the manual version of automation: you write it, you cross it, and you forget it.</p>\n<p>Checklists are also cheap and easy-to-write documentation.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I would dare to go further.</p>\n<p>In computing (and life in general), there are a few principles that I consider extremely important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Repeatability</strong>: repeat a task in a predictable manner and efficiently without dreading it;</li>\n<li><strong>Robustness</strong>: ensure you are doing the right steps and actions all the time, consistently;</li>\n<li><strong>Shareability</strong>: share information painlessly with other people, and more importantly, your future self;<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup></li>\n<li><strong>Mastery</strong>: learn your tools, the shortcuts, and the customization points. This is physical automation: you train your body to repeat stuffs quickly without thinking about it;<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup></li>\n<li><strong>Documentability</strong>: enrich your knowledge base constantly - that is vitally important. Document what you do and why.<sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a href=\"#fn-5\" class=\"footnote-ref\">5</a></sup> Take notes, create a task in your todo apps to not forget something important. Offload your mind and find any information in no time.<sup id=\"fnref-6\"><a href=\"#fn-6\" class=\"footnote-ref\">6</a></sup></li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's automation, although at a bigger scope than just plain computer automation and scripting. That's why I like to be organized and to create systems in my life (and not only on my computers). It's a way for me to be consistent, coherent, efficient and meticulous. To care about what I do without putting more charge on me. And be able to lose my time on the areas where it provides me joy.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>Which is still a nice perk, we should diminish that property.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>Don't get me wrong: it was not perfect. Some steps were still manual and I could have automated them, but there's a point where a goold ol' checklist is enough and automating becomes a burden. But if it becomes manual, <strong>it needs to be documented</strong>.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-3\">\n<p>That can be a script, a documentation, or a process. That's why, when I find an important information, I store it ASAP in my Dropbox so I can come back to it later. That's also why I'm blogging: to keep the relevant article that I find right at my fingertip. That's why I script: because I don't want to have to memorize it and do mistakes later.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-4\">\n<p>That's why automation-freak like <a href=\"https://textexpander.com/\">text expansion</a> so much. But it can also be optimizing your commute route, or always putting stuffs at the same place in your flat so you don't have to think to locate them.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-4\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-5\">\n<p>When you have a company in France, you need to something called \"l'approbation des comptes\" every year. It's boring, complex, and prone to mistakes. The first I did it, I noted all the steps I need to do while I was learning to do it. The next year, it happened again, and I didn't have any clue what I needed to do. I remembered taking the notes, look at them, and in almost no time, was able to do it again. I could have learned again, but this would have been a big waste a time, and a big chore. Instead, it was just a minor annoyance.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-5\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-6\">\n<p>If I hear someone talking about a thing they like, I note it. Later, when I need to find a gift, I can look at the list. It is not always useful, but people are so happy when you give them something they actually truly wanted.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-6\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"date":"2020-04-27","readableDate":"27 April 2020","title":"Systemic Habits through Automation","showPageTitle":null,"excerptLine":"","excerptQuote":null},"fields":{"path":"/2020/04/automation/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"2d706f28-68ab-584e-b205-372e656bbdc3"}}}
