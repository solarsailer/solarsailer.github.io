He said, it’s fine to disagree, it’s fine to push back, it’s great to have strong opinions and beliefs, but give my ideas some time to set in before you’re sure you want to argue against them. “Five minutes” represented “think”, not react. He was totally right.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>[He] has spent his career thinking about these problems. He’s given it 30 years. And I gave it just a few minutes. Now, certainly he can be wrong and I could be right, but it’s better to think deeply about something first before being so certain you’re right.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>This comes to my mind every time I face new ideas, laws, structures, products, redesigns, or just a change in my life.</p>\n<p>When we talk about politics, for example, it's really easy to dismiss what someone is doing and say \"it's so stupid and I would do <em>this</em> instead of <em>that</em>, of course!\". Without understanding the big picture, or the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs\">keys</a> behind a problem, yeah, for sure we would do differently. This is not a justification for world destruction or horrible legislations, but a mental framework to acquire knowledge about why <em>it's</em> like that and how <em>it</em> could be really improved.</p>\n<p><strong>It's hard</strong>, and we all fell for it, but each time I try to understand the motivation or the <em>why</em> behind something I would push against, it always makes more sense, whether I liked it or not. Then, I get a better grasp on the problem. And sometimes, it can even change my mind.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2018-10-31","readableDate":"31 October 2018","title":"“Give It Five Minutes”","showPageTitle":null,"excerptLine":null,"excerptQuote":{"name":"Richard Saul Wurman","quote":"It’s fine to disagree, it’s fine to push back, it’s great to have strong opinions and beliefs, but give my ideas some time to set in before you’re sure you want to argue against them."}},"fields":{"path":"/2018/10/give-it-five-minutes/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"6948129d-26b9-55b9-a47e-bad2df228643"}}}
