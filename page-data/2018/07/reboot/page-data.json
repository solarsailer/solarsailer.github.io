Otherwise, you know everything. ðŸ˜‰</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I was using <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com\">Jekyll</a> to generate this blog and hosting it with <a href=\"https://pages.github.com\">GitHub Pages</a> (Jekyll is maintained by GitHub, so the workflow to publish a Jekyll site on GitHub is dead simple if you accept their dependencies and constraints). Then, one day, GitHub said that they were deprecating the Markdown engine that I was using, affecting a few posts I wrote.</p>\n<p>I wanted to redesign this site for a long time, so instead of just updating the posts, I decided to rewrite the whole blog (like every developer do each time they have a small change to do â€” it's our curse).</p>\n<p>I experimented. I designed 6 or 8 layouts. I was never happy, and I never gave me the time to finish it properly. When I started to implement a new design, I let it wither for a few months. And when I came back, I just ditched it all. Again. And again. And again.</p>\n<p>I moved the blog to <a href=\"https://gohugo.io\">Hugo</a>. Then I came back to Jekyll once more. I modernized everything. Then I was fed up with Jekyll again, so I tried <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\">Gatsby</a>. And I did other things, abandoning the redesign once again. Meanwhile, and even if I had dozens of drafts, I couldn't update the old blog with new articles. So it languished there, in its infamous uglyness (something I was not proud of, calling myself a <em>designer</em>).</p>\n<p>And finally, I retried Gatsby recently and completed a new design. It's not perfect. It's not well tested on older browsers. But it works, in a good enough way for me â€” I have already spent too much time on it.</p>\n<p>I've also cut the dependency I had on GitHub Pages. I'm still using GitHub to host this website, but the workflow is separated and I'm free to use what I want.</p>\n<p><strong>It's time to ship.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>More than just a simple redesign, I wanted to reboot the site to add a <strong>portfolio</strong>, a <strong>resume</strong>, a <strong>documentationÂ·codexÂ·tutorials</strong>, as well as a <strong>photo</strong> and <strong>automation</strong> sections. Of course, if I wanted to do it all, I would never have finished anything, so I just focused on a simple redesign at the time being, keeping in mind that the site would be expanded later.</p>\n<p>The goal, in the end, is to do all that â€” if I'm motivated enough. A good start would be to publish new articles with a regular schedule.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Another thing that was ticking for this website was the \"deprecation\" of <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html\">HTTP by Chrome in an upcoming update</a>. By deprecation, I mean that Chrome will show an \"Unsecure\" flag on non-HTTPS websites. HTTP will always work, but it will be relegated to a legacy protocol that nobody should continue to use.</p>\n<p>I was in a hurry to complete this reboot before this update. I soft-launched the new site a few weeks ago, and tweaked it since. And now it's official.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>To be a little bit exhaustive:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have 6 designs in Sketch files, plus a few more that I did directly in the browser.</li>\n<li>I did more than 50 logos. And I'm still not satisfied by the one I use now (it's not the best that I did, but I think it fits better with the layout and what I wanted to do). It's so hard to capture the essence of something personal. It's a blank canvas without any constraints.</li>\n<li>I tried 4 or 5 blog engines (<a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com\">Jekyll</a>, <a href=\"http://www.metalsmith.io\">Metalsmith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\">Gatsby</a>, <a href=\"https://gohugo.io\">Hugo</a> and others). I even toyed with the idea of creating my own.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm so exhausted by this whole process and that's mainly why I'm so long to end this blog post. ðŸ˜‡</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I hope you'll like it.</p>\n<h2>Update <span class=\"more\">18 October 2018</span></h2>\n<p>I've renamed the site to simply \"Matthieu Oger\". The \"brand\" I was trying to create with the \"Solar Sailer\" name was not working at all. It's better to just drop it and use my name as of now.
