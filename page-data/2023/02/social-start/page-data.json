Most people didn’t even know that there was a network behind it. It was a filter app. <em>My intention was always for it to be a social app, and I was bummed when everyone talked about it as a filter app.</em></p>\n<p>But <mark>what I realized in there is that the best networks are first to utility, and then they piggyback on that utility, and they become a network</mark>. I think Facebook’s actually a great example of this. It may not be so clear, but <em>it was clearly just a directory at the beginning</em>. It was about finding people, communicating with them. And then it became the social network that it became once they added the news feed and all this other stuff.</p>\n<p>So Instagram and Facebook are actually not that different in their evolution. [We decided] when we talked about launch, that <em>we were just going to focus on the utility part of it first</em> and be really good at that <strong>because starting a social network from scratch, I think, is the wrong order.</strong></p>\n<p>You see a lot of people launching things today that are social networks first and then utility is questionable. And it’s because <mark>the utility in the social network only makes sense when you’re at scale</mark>, when you have <em>a lot of people</em>. And it’s very hard to bootstrap that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><small>(Emphasis mine)</small></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2023-02-17","readableDate":"17 February 2023","title":"On Instagram's Start","showPageTitle":null,"excerptLine":null,"excerptQuote":{"name":"Kevin Systrom","quote":"The best [social networks] are first to utility, and then they piggyback on that utility, and they become a network.
