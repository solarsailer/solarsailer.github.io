For me, delight is born from a tool’s intuitiveness. Things just working without much thought or fiddling. Delight is a simple menu system you almost never have to use. Delight is a well-balanced weight on the shoulder, in the hand. Delight is the just-right tension on the aperture ring between stops. Delight is a single battery lasting all day. Delight is being able to knock out a 10,000 iso image and know it'll be usable. Delight is extracting gorgeous details from the cloak of shadows. Delight is firing off a number of shots without having to wait for the buffer to catch up. Delight is constraints, joyfully embraced.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bonus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It should not exist. It is one of those unicorn-like consumer products that so nails nearly every aspect of its being — from industrial to software design, from interface to output — that you can’t help but wonder how it clawed its way from the R&#x26;D lab. Out of the meetings. Away from the committees. How did it manage to maintain such clarity in its point of view?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Q — like most recent Leicas — is engraved with the softly geometric, proprietary LG 1050 typeface. It feels so, totally, completely at home, stamped into the camera body in all caps. It's highly legible and precisely designed. Minimal, functional, but with a bit of quirky character. Like the Q itself. This is the perfect camera typeface used in the perfect way. Mic dropped. Case closed.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"date":"2016-03-19","readableDate":"19 March 2016","title":"Delight","showPageTitle":null,"excerptLine":null,"excerptQuote":{"name":"Craig Mod","quote":"And what is delight?
