The problem is that there isn't a lot of patches (a patch is like an instance of a class in a classic object-oriented programming language) dedicated to user interface in Quartz Composer.</p>\n<p>That's where Origami steps in:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Origami provides a set of tools for Quartz Composer that make interaction prototyping a lot easier.</p>\n<p>Animations, transitions, buttons, layers, phones, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I recommend to watch <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/85578380\">this video</a> to get a brief overview of what is possible with Origami. It's intriguing, it looks promising and it motivates me to learn Quartz Composer more seriously.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2014-02-05","readableDate":"05 February 2014","title":"Interaction Prototyping with Origami","showPageTitle":null,"excerptLine":null,"excerptQuote":{"name":"Facebook","quote":"Origami provides a set of tools for Quartz Composer that make interaction prototyping a lot easier."}},"fields":{"path":"/2014/02/origami-quartz-composer/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"306fdb81-f48c-5ff2-95b9-f9c7625d84ba"}}}
