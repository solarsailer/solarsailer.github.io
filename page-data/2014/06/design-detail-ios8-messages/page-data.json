It's so simple that I don't know why it hasn't been done already (it might, I just don't know of an app that have done that).</p>\n<p>Here it is:</p>\n<figure>\n  <img\n    src=\"/images/posts/2014-06-03-picker-8.png\"\n    alt=\"Image Picker in iOS 8 Messages app\"\n    title=\"iOS 8 Messages\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>It's not a button. It's a grid of three (or more) images.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>It solves three problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can use the last photo. 80% of the time, it's what you (and I) want to do.</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can see the last photo and be sure of what you are doing <strong>BEFORE</strong> doing it.</p>\n<p>With a button, the app had to provide a way to check the action.</p>\n<p>In Tweetbot, for example, the compose view shows a small thumbnail of the image.</p>\n<p>In Droplr, it's too late. As soon as you tap the button, the photo is uploaded and you have to delete it to fix your error.</p>\n</li>\n<li>You can use the last few photos too. Which might represent 80% of the last remaining use cases.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's so simple and clever that once you have seen it, you can only think: <em>\"Of course.\"</em>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2014-06-03","readableDate":"03 June 2014","title":"Design Detail in iOS 8 Messages","showPageTitle":null,"excerptLine":"One of the features that I wanted the most in iOS 8 was simple: Add a “Use Last Photo Taken” button in the Messages app.","excerptQuote":null},"fields":{"path":"/2014/06/design-detail-ios8-messages/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"ac8167ae-5d47-541f-a5df-ee0a79445fbf"}}}
