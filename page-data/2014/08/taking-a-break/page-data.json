Especially your legs and your back.</li>\n<li>It gets you out of your computer.</li>\n<li>It rests your eyes. Try to fix an object at 15m and blink your eyes a few times. It's a good way to not only use your close-sight during work.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's a simple habit, but it's hard to get used to it. For the last weeks, I forced myself to walk for 3 minutes every 1 hour of work.</p>\n<p>Andâ€¦ it's great. I'm really feeling much more concentrated and ready.</p>\n<p>Because I will forget to stand up as soon as I'm working, <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/solarsailer/6328415616b485ff7bef\">I've made a little \"app\" for OSX</a>.

It costs nothing, and your body will love it.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2014-08-01","readableDate":"01 August 2014","title":"Taking a Break","showPageTitle":null,"excerptLine":"A common good practice recommended by almost any home-worker is to take a quick (3 minutes) <em>walking</em> break every 45 minutes or so.","excerptQuote":null},"fields":{"path":"/2014/08/taking-a-break/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"93b71f6a-9239-5a25-b2fa-846110119e87"}}}
