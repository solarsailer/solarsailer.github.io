It's an attempt to elaborate on <a href=\"https://matthieuoger.com/2021/03/build-right-swiftly/#fnref-4\">this footnote</a>.</em></small></p>\n<hr>\n<p>I recently spent a fair amount of time searching for <em>good</em> feedback tools.</p>\n<p>At this time, we were building a new product that would be used by hundreds of users, and getting their feedback was invaluable, as well as non-negotiable. It was in a business to business context, and clients were expecting us to take everything into account (spoiler: this is impossible, and would result in a terrible product).</p>\n<p>Our original approach was, surprisingly, to use a spreadsheet<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>. I knew right from the start that this approach would not scale.<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> However, we had nothing better at this stage, so we had to deal with this spreadsheet from hell. I started to look for better tools, and stumbled upon ProductBoard, Canny and a few others. I played with almost all of them. In the end, ProductBoard was the only viable solution (because of the other features the app was providing, not just feedback), but I still had the impression that the feedback part of the app was not enough, or, more likely, not adequate enough.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>[add intro about productboard and my search]</p>\n<p>I was thinking about the feedback topic again recently. It got better with Productboard and the “Insights” panel, but I’m still wondering if it’s the right approach (as you can see, I’m not 100% satisfied by this part).</p>\n<p>I had a kind of epiphany a few days ago. What if we did this the wrong way? Ie. instead of thinking as feedback as a qualitative data that needs immediate response, what if it was quantitative data only?</p>\n<p>So, the right tool to tackle this problem would not be something that allows you to read everything, but something akin to a search engine or an analytics product.\nWhen we try to experiment and come up with new ideas, we could open this tool and dive into the data to confirm or infirm some hypothesis. We could build trend of satisfaction, or pinpoint the main areas of problem in our apps.</p>\n<p>By letting go of the qualitative aspect of feedback, we could ignore “urgency” and supposedly “critical topics” that a handful of people are talking about.</p>\n<p>The more I was thinking about it, the more I became confident that the correct way to handle feedback would something like Elastic Kibana (or similar tools) — ie. something build to handle natural language and texts in quantity. A feedback would simply be “a log”, that we can process through machine learning and look at via dashboard.</p>\n<p>Technically, a PM’s daily task is to check the analytics to find patterns and journeys. Reading the feedback is another part of the job, even if no tool is able to make this task enjoyable today. By shifting our approach, we could simply look at analytics and a Kibana-like, to get an overview and distinguish trends quickly. When we write a brief, we could search in both databases. When a client is becoming irrational, we could look at all this data and explain that “no, it’s not that big of a deal”.</p>\n<p>The main issue, of course, is that it would only work “at scale” — we need a sufficient amount of feedback.</p>\n<p>We could generate surveys (via Intercom or other tools) in our apps to gather feedback more often, and integrate that in the tool. We could get other streams of data from social networks (for marketing purposes), but also internally.</p>\n<p>I started to dive a bit more into what we could do and found this interesting video from Elastic: <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/webinars/observability-and-sentiment-analysis-in-a-single-platform-wit\">https://www.elastic.co/webinars/observability-and-sentiment-analysis-in-a-single-platform-wit</a> h-the-elk-stack</p>\n<p>Problems:</p>\n<p>Reading feedback is not enjoyable</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Tools</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spreadsheet are terrible at this job</li>\n<li>Productboard is better, but the tool consider that feedback need to be classified, managed and assigned to features manually and regularly — it still views feedback as qualitative data</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It’s hard to build trends and patterns in spreadsheets because it requires manual classification and analysis before. The freeform aspect does not help</li>\n<li>We need better search tools to dive in</li>\n<li>Machine learning is ideal to solve this kind of problems</li>\n<li>Feedback are not qualitative data — if you think about feedback this way, you take\nsubjective decisions because you focus on a few bad (or good) opinions, and ignore most users (ie. this is what is happening when a big client is asking for a big thing that is not aligned at all with our strategy)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Side-note: Kibana is also a useful combination to product analytics tools (like Amplitude) to gather additional insights about the platform that are not covered by product analytics. It could be metrics, bugs, issues. It’s not something that a product manager will focus a lot on, but it’s useful information nonetheless to decide on the priorities (ie. should we focus on more bugs, stability, or improve our tooling / resilience, are we spending too much on the infra or not enough, etc.). The same way a PM needs to know the revenues of the business, they also need to know the health and quality of the platform (in addition to the UI), because it’s a determining factor for the prioritization process.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Notes 2:</p>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>Spreadsheets are the default way of working for most people (that and emails). It's handy because it's flexible and “cheap”, but that's a bad habit. It locks too many people in this way of thinking, and make them lazy: “Why would I search for a better tool when this one is already available and kind of okay?”. That's the thing however: It's never as efficient as a custom-made tool, it's always ugly, and quickly unpractical when the amount of data grows significantly.</p>\n<p>  It's great to have this as part of one's toolkit. However, like a basic screwdriver, when you want to build something bigger than a shelf, you'll get a dedicated tool.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>For Steredenn, we were using Respond.ly (acquired by Buffer later), Slack and the Steam Community to gather any question or mention about the game on Twitter, email, forums, web-searches, etc.</p>\n<p>  On Respond.ly, we had a way to respond to users directly (like Intercom or Front) if they had any question or feedback about the game.</p>\n<p>  On Slack, we had a room dedicated to notifications, to get a \"sense\" of the trends surrounding the game. A new release would generate a lot of feedback, and on normal days, we would get around a dozen mentions. A huge issue was visible quickly because we could get a spike in notifications.</p>\n<p>  Finally, we had the Steam Community board where users would post <em>very</em> detailed feedback about the game. A nice perk of doing videogames.</p>\n<p>  This system worked very well, and got us relevant data about the game. We could have done other things, but this was overall very efficient and valuable.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"date":"2021-04-01","readableDate":"01 April 2021","title":"Product Feedback","showPageTitle":null,"excerptLine":"","excerptQuote":null},"fields":{"path":"/2021/04/product-feedback/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"3e2f1b8c-c720-5eb1-979e-516949deef2c"}}}
