I'm pretty confident that in 20, maybe 40 years, nobody will write actual code for most use cases. We will still have craftsmen, that will build low-level libraries, OSes and computing bricks, then integrated by platforms that everybody will use. Gluing, mixing and combining APIs, UIs, sensors and any other tool will be as simple as piping commands in a shell for a developer today.</p>\n<p>Nowadays' coding is too dangerous, brittle, slow and painful to continue like that forever. It's still baffle me that forgetting brackets around a <code class=\"language-text\">if</code> statement can produce an extremely serious vulnerability issue, that can potentially impact everyone on earth.</p>\n<p>As long as we write code like we did 50 years ago, this will continue to be true. We will continue to make the same mistakes, we will continue to create bugs just by calling an API or rendering a few graphical elements on a screen.
