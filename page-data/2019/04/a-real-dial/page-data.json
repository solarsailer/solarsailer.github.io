The delightful clickiness of it, its precision, the appearance of etched metal… Delicious. How could we possibly translate this to a digital user interface? You’d just be tapping on glass.</p>\n<p>[…] The only issue was that my big silly thumb would totally obscure the control. […]</p>\n<p>But we didn’t have to also emulate the limitations of the physical world along with its wonderful tactile qualities: this is the digital world. We can make tiny phones fly. We can use a machine brain to pick the right settings for you.</p>\n<p>We can make the dial expand gracefully as you select an exposure time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is probably my favorite part of the interface. Everything about it feels and looks perfect; Ben’s custom spring physics, my visual design iterations, and Jelmar’s completely custom typeface we use for the numerals. Three people worked hard on this little doodad — and most users probably wouldn’t even notice the work we put into it!</p>\n<p>I would argue that’s how you know that you’ve made something well.</p>\n<p><strong>When you come across an article set in a superb typeface for reading, some excellent airport signage or a well designed door handle, you don’t think about it or even notice it. If anything you might just notice being happier, or simply not frustrated. That’s how you know a design is great: it <em>disappears</em>.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><small>(Emphasis mine)</small></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2019-04-13","readableDate":"13 April 2019","title":"A Real Dial","showPageTitle":null,"excerptLine":null,"excerptQuote":{"name":"Sebastiaan De With","quote":"When you come across an article set in a superb typeface for reading, some excellent airport signage or a well designed door handle, you don’t think about it or even notice it.
