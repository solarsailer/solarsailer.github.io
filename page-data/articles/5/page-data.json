[…]</p>\n<p>The Netflix Quantum Theory doc spelled out ways of tagging movie endings, the \"social acceptability\" of lead characters, and dozens of other facets of a movie. Many values are \"scalar,\" that is to say, they go from 1 to 5. So, every movie gets a romance rating, not just the ones labeled \"romantic\" in the personalized genres. Every movie's ending is rated from happy to sad, passing through ambiguous. Every plot is tagged. Lead characters' jobs are tagged. Movie locations are tagged. Everything. Everyone.</p>\n<p>That's the data at the base of the pyramid. It is the basis for creating all the altgenres that I scraped. Netflix's engineers took the microtags and created a syntax for the genres, much of which we were able to reproduce in our generator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This article completely blew my mind.

It's so drastically underpopulated that the show that's a best-fit for the category is <em>enormously</em> popular, much more popular than anyone realized.</p>\n<p>Far from being a \"bug\", this is programming <em>platinum</em> for Netflix. If they're as smart as I think they are, this is the subgenre where they should be looking to make a TV series. The biggest problem will be finding a showrunner and scriptwriters who are able to go against so many of Hollywood's cliches and assumptions. They need to make something where what is visually interesting, striking, or exciting is unimportant, but where there are no holes in the plots. Very high degree of difficulty, and only profitable to Netflix, which makes money from its shows, not from the advertising.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sounds a bit like <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1475582/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\">Sherlock</a>, no?</p>"}}],"pathPrefix":"articles","first":false,"last":false,"index":5,"pageCount":11,"additionalContext":{}}}}
