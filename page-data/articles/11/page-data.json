I’m sorry, but it’s not about changing people, and it’s not about making them do stuff. That’s old school thinking from a time when brands could steamroll their way into the consciousness and wallets of people through clever advertising and sleight of hand. Those days are over. Now our job is not to make it about how awesome we are, <strong>but how well we help people accomplish their goals</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><small>(Emphasis mine)</small></p>\n<p>Further readings related to this subject:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.90percentofeverything.com/2013/07/23/the-slippery-slope/\">The Slippery Slope</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://seriouspony.com/blog/2013/7/24/your-app-makes-me-fat\">Your App Makes Me Fat</a></li>\n</ul>"}},{"node":{"id":"409e2b30-346c-5a75-9b35-97ad3eb07b23","frontmatter":{"path":null,"title":"Zero","date":"2013-08-09","readableDate":"09 August 2013","redirectFrom":null,"excerpt":null,"excerptQuote":{"name":"Zach Holman","quote":"The trick is finding out how you work best.

The trick is finding out how you work best. For me, I tend to take an OCD approach to emptying things. I keep a clean desktop: under three icons at a time, preferably. It made sense to use my desktop as a kind of bucket I needed to empty: it's always there, and I can put short, actionable items there because that visually disturbs me enough to want to clean it off (and do the action).</p>\n<p>This is why Inbox Zero works so well for handling email for me. I try to use that mentality everywhere, really: iOS notifications, browser tabs, terminal tabs, and so on. Reducing ambiguity around what to do next is a huge deal for me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have a similar mindset.
