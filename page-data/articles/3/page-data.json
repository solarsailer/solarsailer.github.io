I looked at other games and saw that it was possible to change its behavior.</p>\n<p>However, it was not really clear how to do that with Unity, so I hope this will help others.</p>\n<h2>Home indicator?</h2>\n<p>Since the iPhone X, the mechanism to go back to the home screen has changed on iOS. You have to swipe from the bottom of the screen, which puts the app back inside its icon.</p>\n<p>By default, at the bottom (where the chin was), the home indicator is <strong>always visible</strong> in an app. It's the black bar you can see on this screenshot:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/home-indicator.jpg\" alt=\"Home indicator default state\"></p>\n<p>For the moment, it's a permanent indicator if the app does not specify a different behavior.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>See what it does in action:</p>\n<figure>\n  <video src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/action.mp4\" width=\"221.5\" height=\"480\" controls muted loop>\n    Your browser doesn't support videos.

With the haptic feedback, it's actually very nice to play with.</p>\n<h2>Changing the behavior in Unity</h2>\n<p>However, this (default) behavior is not great for games. It's too bright and it hides a small portion of the bottom part of the screen. Which can be confusing in games like Steredenn, where many things are displayed at the same time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/steredenn.jpg\" alt=\"Home indicator in Steredenn\"></p>\n<p>Fortunately, Unity (well, technically, it's iOS) provides 2 ways to change the home indicator. Obviously with Unity, the correct one is not the one you would expect.</p>\n<p>You can find these settings by following this procedure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <code class=\"language-text\">Edit → Project Settings → Player</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/unity-01.jpg\" alt=\"Open the Player&#x27;s settings\"></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Then, click on the iOS tab, and find the \"Other Settings\" area.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/unity-02.jpg\" alt=\"Find &#x22;Other Settings&#x22;\"></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Finally, we are interested in 2 settings: \"Hide home button on iPhone X\" and \"Defer system gestures on edges\".</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/unity-03.jpg\" alt=\"&#x22;Hide home button on iPhone X&#x22; and &#x22;Defer system gestures on edges&#x22;\"></p>\n<h2>\"Hide home button on iPhone X\"</h2>\n<p>\"Hide home button on iPhone X\", the one that looks like what we want, is, of course, the <em>wrong one</em>.</p>\n<p>This setting hides the home indicator after a certain inactivity delay. If the user taps on the screen, the home indicator appears again in its full bright glory. In a game, where you will tap all the time, it's the same as showing the indicator permanently.</p>\n<p>Note that this setting can be useful sometimes. For example, if you are doing a video player, or a game that does not require user inputs often, this is what you want. I think there is ways to toggle this behavior when needed.</p>\n<p>This is what YouTube does, for example (it's hard to see cos' the home indicator is black here, but look at the bottom):</p>\n<figure>\n  <video src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/hide.mp4\" controls muted loop>\n    Your browser doesn't support videos.

Perfect.</li>\n<li>To go back to the home screen, you have to do the gesture twice. This is also nice, since it prevents accidental gestures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The \"bottom\" checkbox is enough if you only want to change the home indicator behavior. The other checkboxes can be used for Control Center and other gestures on iPad, I think.</p>\n<p>This is what Alto's Adventure does, as well as Steredenn:</p>\n<figure>\n  <video src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/defer.mp4\" controls muted loop>\n    Your browser doesn't support videos.

First, I noticed the packaging. Unlike the high-quality large-format cardboard boxes with soft colors and thoughtful art, GTR came in a compact, cheap, plastic tub that wasn’t much bigger than a large paperback book. Second, and more jarring, was the game's art. It had a bright color palette and cartoonish characters that seemed like they belonged in a children’s clip art computer game.</p>\n<p>[He] started unpacking the game and patiently explaining the rules. What immediately struck me was the mechanic allowing the player to choose what type any given card would be—one of a few choices that would automatically exclude the others. GTR appeared to be full of intrigue and strategy, and there were multiple ways to win. […]</p>\n<p>In less than a decade, how could a game whose ranking still remains relatively high (150) on Board Game Geek — just a few places above Magic: The Gathering and a few places lower than Carcassonne — have totally disappeared? What happened? […]</p>\n<p>\"It’s one of those games, you just recognize the genius of the design of it,\" Lozito told Ars. \"This is one of the quintessential big games in a small box. Every time you sit down to play it it plays differently, the cards are all crazy. I looked at the game and I have no idea how his brain could come up with such a complex game out of 125 cards or whatever.\" […]</p>\n<p>As GTR continued to gather critical and cult-classic steam, word started getting back to [co-creator Carter] that one of the game’s primary problems was its awful production—those nausea-inducing colors and a cheap plastic box. […]</p>\n<p>[After the Kickstarter's success], this should have been the moment that Carter seized game-design glory. With a successful production, he could have taken the game from indie cult favorite to something much bigger. But according to Rao, this influx of cash instead represented the beginning of the end.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's a description from Ed Carter, one of the \"co-creators\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Early on, Glory To Rome was often called \"San Juan on Steroids,\" but it would probably be more accurate to call it \"San Juan meets Magic The Gathering.\" There are 40 different cards in Glory To Rome and each one has a unique ability. Only four of them are sensible \"Improve your X by Y\" abilities—the rest are ridiculous, convoluted powers like \"Incomplete MARBLE structures provide function.\" That generates 760 different two-card combinations and many thousands of three-card ones. I've played hundreds of games of GTR over the years so I've thought about a lot of these combinations, but certainly not all of them.</p>\n<p>Also, while most games are balanced using a stable equilibrium with the aim that no card should be so overpowering that it breaks the game, Glory To Rome is balanced using astable equilibrium—our aim was that in the right combinations, virtually every card would be able to contribute to a runaway victory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was never aware that the game was unavailable. I got a copy of the French version (by Filosofia) a few years ago when it was in store almost anywhere in France, in a reprinted and decent version, so this story is all news to me. It's funny to think that the game was \"everywhere\" here, but unavailable in its home-country.</p>\n<p>It's a shame though, since the game is really, <em>really</em> great.</p>\n<p><em>Side note: the work by <a href=\"https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/643046/poll-would-you-buy-re-design-glory-rome\">Heiko Günther</a> is beautiful too. I think that the French version is clearer in an actual game, but wow this is pretty.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>This article makes me think that many boardgames disappear each year, going unnoticed and forgotten forever.</p>\n<p>I wrote about <a href=\"https://matthieuoger.com/2015/09/quantum-post-mortem/\">Quantum</a> before, one of my favorite boardgames, which is out of stock too.

The disturbing thing, however, is that most of these games are, actually, great games.</p>\n<p>Only a small and highly-successful portion of all the boardgames will be kept forever (Catan, Race for the Galaxy, Carcassonne, Monopoly, 7 Wonders, etc.).

Otherwise, you know everything. 😉</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I was using <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com\">Jekyll</a> to generate this blog and hosting it with <a href=\"https://pages.github.com\">GitHub Pages</a> (Jekyll is maintained by GitHub, so the workflow to publish a Jekyll site on GitHub is dead simple if you accept their dependencies and constraints). Then, one day, GitHub said that they were deprecating the Markdown engine that I was using, affecting a few posts I wrote.</p>\n<p>I wanted to redesign this site for a long time, so instead of just updating the posts, I decided to rewrite the whole blog (like every developer do each time they have a small change to do — it's our curse).</p>\n<p>I experimented. I designed 6 or 8 layouts. I was never happy, and I never gave me the time to finish it properly. When I started to implement a new design, I let it wither for a few months. And when I came back, I just ditched it all. Again. And again. And again.</p>\n<p>I moved the blog to <a href=\"https://gohugo.io\">Hugo</a>. Then I came back to Jekyll once more. I modernized everything. Then I was fed up with Jekyll again, so I tried <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\">Gatsby</a>. And I did other things, abandoning the redesign once again. Meanwhile, and even if I had dozens of drafts, I couldn't update the old blog with new articles. So it languished there, in its infamous uglyness (something I was not proud of, calling myself a <em>designer</em>).</p>\n<p>And finally, I retried Gatsby recently and completed a new design. It's not perfect. It's not well tested on older browsers. But it works, in a good enough way for me — I have already spent too much time on it.</p>\n<p>I've also cut the dependency I had on GitHub Pages. I'm still using GitHub to host this website, but the workflow is separated and I'm free to use what I want.</p>\n<p><strong>It's time to ship.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>More than just a simple redesign, I wanted to reboot the site to add a <strong>portfolio</strong>, a <strong>resume</strong>, a <strong>documentation·codex·tutorials</strong>, as well as a <strong>photo</strong> and <strong>automation</strong> sections. Of course, if I wanted to do it all, I would never have finished anything, so I just focused on a simple redesign at the time being, keeping in mind that the site would be expanded later.</p>\n<p>The goal, in the end, is to do all that — if I'm motivated enough. A good start would be to publish new articles with a regular schedule.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Another thing that was ticking for this website was the \"deprecation\" of <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html\">HTTP by Chrome in an upcoming update</a>. By deprecation, I mean that Chrome will show an \"Unsecure\" flag on non-HTTPS websites. HTTP will always work, but it will be relegated to a legacy protocol that nobody should continue to use.</p>\n<p>I was in a hurry to complete this reboot before this update. I soft-launched the new site a few weeks ago, and tweaked it since. And now it's official.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>To be a little bit exhaustive:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have 6 designs in Sketch files, plus a few more that I did directly in the browser.</li>\n<li>I did more than 50 logos. And I'm still not satisfied by the one I use now (it's not the best that I did, but I think it fits better with the layout and what I wanted to do). It's so hard to capture the essence of something personal. It's a blank canvas without any constraints.</li>\n<li>I tried 4 or 5 blog engines (<a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com\">Jekyll</a>, <a href=\"http://www.metalsmith.io\">Metalsmith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\">Gatsby</a>, <a href=\"https://gohugo.io\">Hugo</a> and others).

You shouldn’t have popular bugs. […] I added taverns to fortress mode, so the dwarves will go to a proper establishment, get mugs, and make orders, and they’ll drink in the mug. And, you know, things happen, mugs get spilled, there’s some alcohol on the ground.</p>\n<p>Now, the cats would walk into the taverns, right, and because of the old blood footprint code from, like, eight years ago or something, they would get alcohol on their feet. It was originally so people could pad blood around, but now any liquid, right, so they get alcohol on their feet. And then I wanted to add cleaning stuff so when people were bathing, or I even made eyelids work for no reason, because I do random things sometimes. So cats will lick and clean themselves, and on a lark, when I made them clean themselves I’m like, ‘Well, it’s a cat. When you do lick cleaning, you actually ingest the thing that you’re cleaning off, right? They make hairballs, so they must swallow something, right?' And so the cats, when they cleaned the alcohol off their feet, they all got drunk. Because they were drinking.</p>\n<p>But the numbers were off on that. I had never thought about, you know, activating inebriation syndromes back when I was adding the cleaning stuff. I was just like, ‘Well, they ingest it and they get a full dose,’ but a full dose is a whole mug of alcohol for a cat-sized creature, and it does all the blood alcohol size-based calculations, so the cats would get sick and vomit all over the tavern.</p>\n<p>The original bug report is, ‘There’s cat vomit all over my tavern, and there’s a few dead cats,’ or whatever, and they’re like, ‘Why? This is broken.’</p>\n<p>People helped me with this. We were all looking and figuring out, ‘What the heck is going on here?’, and that was the chain of events. It’s like doing the detective work to figure out that entire chain of events is what happened. You can see how adding just a tavern that gave the opportunity for spilling alcohol, which was really uncommon before, now all the spilled alcohol starts to, form in one location where something could start to happen. You activate bugs and little parts of code from eight, six years ago where you just didn’t balance the numbers because it didn’t matter. […]</p>\n<p><strong>PC Gamer: So the cats’ inebriation system was just based on any organism would have the potential to get drunk.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, right now it’s any creature that has blood, and that includes, like, an octopus. I don’t know if an octopus can get drunk or not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The way the different systems are all interacting together is so fascinating. Especially when the outcome becomes something like this. :)</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don’t even use version control. If you don’t know what that is then you’re not gonna yell at me. If you even know what version control is you’re gonna be like, ‘You don’t use version control? You don’t use source control? What is wrong with you? How can you even work?’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm still baffled to know that many game developers (or other developers) work without version control.

Church</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>First, let's cover the technical issues. It's verbose, combines the worst of both worlds between static and dynamic typing by having a hobbled but extremely clunky type system, and mandates running on a virtual machine (VM) that has a macroscopic startup time (not an issue for long-running servers, but painful for command-line applications). […]</p>\n<p>The VM itself has a lot to recommend it. It offers concurrency and garbage collection at a level of quality that, until recently, wasn't found anywhere else. […] Much important software in the early 2000s was written in Java because, at the time, it was the best choice, even taking the mediocrity of the language itself into account. It had Unicode (albeit, UTF-16) from the start and a strong concurrency story, and it was a notch above C++ in terms of user experience. […]</p>\n<p>If you put Java on a technical trial, it doesn't do so bad. The <em>language</em> sucks, the platform is pretty good for most purposes. I do hate the dominant interpretation of \"object-oriented programming\" with a passion, because it objectively sucks. […]</p>\n<p>So let's talk about the political and cultural issues. First, the dominant Java culture is one of mediocrity and bad taste, with MetaModelVibratorVisitorFactory classes dominating. I've heard a number of experts on \"the Java issue\" argue that Java's biggest problem is the community, and that comes directly from the fact that good programmers don't want to deal with the bastardization of OOP that has entrenched itself in mainstream corporate development. You have a lot of people who trained up as \"Java programmers\", haven't seen a command line ever, and have no clue how the computer actually works. Most of them have never actually written a program; they just write classes and some Senior Chief Architect (who makes $246,001 per year and hasn't written a line of code since the 1990s) figures out how to stitch them together, and then tells some other clueless junior how to implement the glue in the gutshot hope that one will actually have the talent to make an actual working program out of the mess.</p>\n<p>This isn't inherent to the JVM, because Clojure (currently hosted on the JVM, although its endgame seems to be language-agnosticism) has a radically different (and better) community. Scala's community is more mixed, but the top Scala engineers (the ones making tools like Spark and Kestrel) are really fucking good.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>So, the short answer is: it's mostly not about the underlying platform (which is generally of high quality) and its only partly about the language (which is mediocre but can't be blamed directly for community problems). It goes a lot deeper than that, and not all of it is Java's fault. However, Java takes its share of the blame for its clear favoritism toward large programs (technically, established by its long startup time) and by its support of a very ugly (and counterproductive) variety of object-oriented programming.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Why-do-many-software-engineers-not-like-Java/answer/Stanley-Idesis\">Stanley Idesis</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’ve read the popular answers and will claim no contest to a majority of the complaints I found. […] However, here’s why I <em>love</em> it. […]</p>\n<p>In the Android world, developers use Java because they <em>have</em> to. However, much creativity has sprung from that limitation.

I may (must?) be completely wrong—after all, I hold an unpopular opinion and many tech companies seem to think otherwise. We'll see.</em>‍ 🤷\n  <br><br>\n</small>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality\">Virtual Reality</a> (or VR) is a fantasy that many geeks love. It's in books, in movies, in games. In our collective mind, virtual reality is like flying cars: it's a dream that we always envisioned for our future as an high tech society.</p>\n<p>Well, we all remember that we didn't get flying cars for the new millenium.</p>\n<p>Incredible technologies portrayed in science-fiction books or movies are generally not really that relevant in reality. Or they are so hard to build that we can't even fathom to create them now. In our history, the way our society evolved was often very different to how we imagined it in our fictions. When you confront with the reality, many dreams are just what they are: dreams. I would need to dig up some sociology courses that I had—but I remember that this is a recurrent theme in our evolution.</p>\n<p>For VR, it's a bit different: we (almost) have the technology. However, I do think that it's just a fad. A fad that excites many marketers or entrepreneurs. <em>Real-world applications are so narrow.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>VR is a cool demo. VR is impressive. Even with our primitive VR technologies, it's still incredible to try.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>VR is also making people sick—yes, many people suffer from motion sickness.</p>\n<p>VR is pretty boring for games, its main application right now. Yes, the immersion is better. Nop, the controls are worse. You can't move in a game without hitting a wall. You can't use your hands without complex gloves or other utensils. The possibility are not that huge: okay, it might be great for some first-person games where you don't move. But that's just a small subset of all the games we can create.</p>\n<p>VR is ugly. VR is cumbersome. VR is like Google Glass (remember that?) in so many ways.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img\n    src=\"/images/posts/2016-03-17-virtual-reality.png\"\n    alt=\"Men and women sitting with a VR headset, Mark Zuckerberg marching among them.\"\n    title=\"The future?\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>The future? Really?</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>If you're at home, it might be fine, although that wearing another thing on your head is not that comfy. I already wear glasses, I really don't want to add something more on my head, I assure you. Especially if it means that I might hit a wall someway.<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>Outside? At work? We are going to need many years to be okay with that.</p>\n<p>The day we'll be able to have VR headsets the size of a regular pair of glasses is far. We might be already destroying our eyes by viewing screens all day—I can't wait to wear VR headsets a few centimeters from my retinas all the time!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>VR is not completely useless. There's some fields where virtual reality might be useful. Want to visit a new flat in a town far far away? You're a future surgeon and you need to practice during your school years? There's a myriad of applications outside of gaming and home uses.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, right now, people imagine that VR will be used to handle and manipulate softwares, computers or playing games. That's absurd.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Using VR to work on scenes in the Unity Editor: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/timoni\">@timoni</a>&#39;s demo on-stage at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GDC16?src=hash\">#GDC16</a>: <a href=\"https://t.co/tbUmVAemBU\">https://t.co/tbUmVAemBU</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/unity3d?src=hash\">#unity3d</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/T1EH8MsLWb\">pic.twitter.com/T1EH8MsLWb</a></p>&mdash; Ben Pitt (@robotduck) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robotduck/status/709810463886934016\">March 15, 2016</a></blockquote>\n<p>Seriously?
