It looks very cool, but in reality, it's almost useless on a phone.</p>\n<p>Most users are just using the portrait mode all the time, and the landscape orientation is often toggled by accident while in bed or couch.</p>\n<p>That's why many users are activating the rotation lock permanently (I'm in this category).

[…]</p>\n<p>Let's say it takes 10.000 iterations to make a product great. You have to keep polishing, to keep refining and it takes around 10.000 iterations. <strong>The whole point is: how fast can you do each iteration?</strong></p>\n<p>At my previous company [dealing with security software, bank, government, etc.] <em>it would literally take a year and a half to do an iteration</em>. [You were making] some software, [sell it to an entity], deploy it, [deal with pilots], have a formal feedback. If it's gonna take a year and a half to make improvements to the product and you need to make 10.000 iterations, it's <strong>fifteen thousand years</strong> to make a great product. You just don't have this kind of time.</p>\n<p>At Evernote […] an iteration was twenty minutes, because we would just make something — and then, if we were honest with ourselves —, we could say \"does this feel better or worse than it did twenty minutes ago?\". And so, by having this really fast, really tight iteration loops […] we could just move really really quickly. <strong>We could make a product pretty good faster than I ever thought possible before.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And, as a consequence, the time to make a product <em>great</em> (not just \"pretty good\") is also reduced.</p>\n<p>One note though: we need to be careful not to confuse \"speed of iteration\" with \"velocity\".</p>\n<p>\"Iteration\" is your ability to experiment and refine a feature. You can iterate a lot but just release a very few impactful features (which is good). To the contrary, you can iterate slowly and output a lof of very low value, unpolished and mediocre features.<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>Speed of iteration is important.<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup> Meaningless velocity is not. It's more debt, it's harder to maintain, and it results in more complex products for users.</p>\n<p>See “<a href=\"https://itamargilad.com/velocity-vs-impact/\">Stop Obsessing Over Development Velocity, Focus on This Instead</a>” for a good \"factual\" overview.</p>\n<h2>User feedback</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"transcript\">\n<p>It isn't so much that we didn't listen to our users. We listened to our users very carefully but in a very specific way. We listened to how they were reacting to what we were putting in front of them. We <strong>weren't</strong> asking them about what they wanted. […]</p>\n<p>If you ask users what they want, they are not gonna tell you what they want because they don't know. <strong>Very few people can articulate and have the power of imagination to envision what they actually want.</strong></p>\n<p>If you ask customers or prospective customers what they want, they'll tell you the stuff that they expect… and <em>very rarely will that actually be what they want</em>. [Then, he quotes Henry Ford famous line: “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”]. We don't ask customers what they want, we ask customers to respond to what we are giving them. Because then, it's much more useful: you can tell when people are confused, when they are happy, when they are satisfied and then we can decide who to ignore, which opinion to take seriously, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is one of the topics I'm coming back to frequently in my job.</p>\n<p>How can you gather as much feedback as possible, while not becoming crushed by its weight or clients' expectations?</p>\n<p>Moreover, collecting the feedback is only one side of the coin (and the easy one). The second side is <em>how to digest it properly</em>. There, you discover that the product manager's toolkit is, unfortunately, very empty.<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>Users feedback are <em>critically important insights</em>, but it should be seen as an additional knowledge base for future decisions and hypotheses.

There's always this balance of “what's the right amount of focus?”.</p>\n<p>It's hard to know in the moment… you can only do that in hindsight — if you succeed, you had the right amount of focus. If you don't, then you are either doing too much stuff, and you didn't have that focus, or not enough stuff, and you weren't thinking big enough or whatever.</p>\n<p>We always struggle with that balance. What is too much to build and what is just the right amount? How do we know? […] In hindsight, I would have worked for longer on some specific things before moving on to introduce [new features].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This reminds me of a comment made by a candidate during an interview: <em>“One crucial part of a product manager's job is not about which features should be included, but which one should be removed or ignored”</em> (paraphrasing).</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>I slightly edited Phil Libin's speech to make it more readable in a written form.

Tools that were not conceived for this problem specifically, but instead to digest, process, present and search raw data in quantity. Which is what user feedback is: information logs, but provided by users instead of machines.</p>\n<p>  See it similarly to an analytics tool: you would consult the platform everyday to have an overview of your users, how they feel about your product, and what they expect. Use that as additional data for experiments and ideas. When you look at analytics, you don't act immediately, and you cannot answer questions there. You use this trove of data to refine your hypotheses. Feedback should be seen the same way.</p>\n<p>  Using this approach would also remove the emotion from the equation.

But it becomes a mess much more quickly, especially if you are working with more junior developers. You need even more discipline and rigor. It's possible for a one-man website, but it can break quickly as you add more people on a project if the experience level differs a lot.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"}},{"node":{"id":"1101a221-57ff-59c0-8316-e4874216baf4","frontmatter":{"path":null,"title":"The 100ms Rule","date":"2020-05-06","readableDate":"06 May 2020","redirectFrom":null,"excerpt":null,"excerptQuote":{"name":"Superhuman","quote":"Every interaction should be faster than 100ms.

We were excited about the new possibilities it opened up.</strong></p>\n<p>As the decades went by, software became more common. It became a larger part of our lives and an important part of how the world operates.</p>\n<p>Today software is everywhere, but it’s become increasingly rare to encounter truly great software. Computers are faster but apps work slower. Corners are cut with each release. Product decisions are driven by A/B tests.</p>\n<p>We’ve lost the magic along the way. And the result is software that’s frustrating and boring to use.</p>\n<p>We want to bring that magic back.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Linear was born out of our own frustrations in building software projects in successful high-growth companies. We saw the effects of subpar tools and practices in our teams, so we decided to build something better.</strong></p>\n<p>[…] We’re creating software for teams who want to create impact. We think the software you use every day to work should be of the highest quality. It should feel exciting and enticing. It should be fast. And you should feel empowered when using it. Professional tools should have professional quality.</p>\n<p>We truly believe that the tools teams use directly impact the outcome of their work. Bad tools encourage bad habits. Good tools encourage good habits.</p>\n<p>The tools we use should make us more powerful and help us to accomplish our goals. […]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>We believe that the quality of software is driven both by the talent of its creators and how they feel while they’re crafting it. Teams that are excited, engaged and proud of their work build better software.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've rarely read a company's vision <em>this</em> good and exciting. And, damn, their website looks <em>so nice</em>.</p>"}}],"pathPrefix":"articles","first":true,"last":false,"index":1,"pageCount":10,"additionalContext":{}}}}
