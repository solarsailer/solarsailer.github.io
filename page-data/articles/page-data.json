The end-goal is to work less (or not all), enjoy the present, improve quality of life for everyone, while still being able to deliver great services and products for an healthier society.

I fell on a <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_ferriss_why_you_should_define_your_fears_instead_of_your_goals/transcript?language=en\">video by Tim Ferriss which looked kinda okay</a> — I didn't know the guy that much, except that he was the host of a famous podcast which never interested me particularly.</p>\n<p>It was about \"defining fears instead of goals\".

I continued.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, I still think about this talk regularly, even 7 months later. This is what I kept in mind:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the Greco-Roman world, people used stoicism as a comprehensive system for doing many, many things. But for our purposes, chief among them was training yourself to separate what you can control from what you cannot control, and then doing exercises to focus exclusively on the former. This decreases emotional reactivity, which can be a superpower.</p>\n<p> […] And I did find a quote that made a big difference in my life, which was, \"We suffer more often in imagination than in reality,\" by Seneca the Younger, who was a famous Stoic writer.</p>\n<p>[…] \"The Cost of Inaction.\" Humans are very good at considering what might go wrong if we try something new, say, ask for a raise. What we don't often consider is the atrocious cost of the status quo -- not changing anything.</p>\n<p>[…] And the last was his mantra, which he applies to everything, and you can apply to everything:</p>\n<p><strong>\"Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life.\"</strong></p>\n<p>The hard choices -- what we most fear doing, asking, saying -- these are very often exactly what we most need to do. And the biggest challenges and problems we face will never be solved with comfortable conversations, whether it's in your own head or with other people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Initially, we were not sure what to think of this. Then, we discussed a bit. This sounded so logical, so simple, <em>so obvious</em>. But yet, thinking in these terms was really eye-opening.</p>\n<p>This talk is weird, disconcerting, with a strange tone and discourse. A bit pompous, especially with the business references distilled inside some really horrible anecdotes.

The first time was in June for one week, and the second time in the last two weeks. It was for work, but all in all, I still had almost 3 full week-ends to discover the city properly.</p>\n<p><strong>Singapore is really incredible</strong>. It's full of surprises, with gigantic skyscrapers, mind-blowing structures and some ancient places hidden inside the districts (although not as frequently as what you can find in Japan, for example).</p>\n<p>It mixes many asian cultures. The official language is English, but many others are spoken everywhere (chinese, indian, malay, indonesian, etc.). Food is available in abundance and diversity<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>. The city is really busy during the day (a lot less at night in my opinion), and everything seems to change quite often (eg. governement and companies are not afraid to tear down a building to build another one 10 years later). Men presence is omnipresent: new lands are created on the sea, and nature is tightly contained. It's fascinating, even though the country is an environmental aberration (overuse of air conditioning, for example).</p>\n<p>There's no season, and it's always the same weather: 28-32°C (probably around 40°C felt), warm, <em>extremely humid</em>, and cloudy with occasional rains or thunderstorms. Even at night (which starts around 19:30), it will still be warm (just 2-3°C cooler if you are lucky). You could be in short and t-shirt all year, and if you stay 30 min outside, you'll inevitably sweat.</p>\n<p>There are tunnels and malls everywhere, so if you want to avoid the heat, you just have to go inside a building to cool down<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>, \"thanks to\" the overabondance of AC<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Finally, Singapore is really, <strong>really</strong>, safe. As a man, I don't feel unsafe most of the time, but still, you can feel the difference there. It can be 3:00 at night and you'll never feel threatened. You can forget something and go back one day later and find it again. It's when you go back home that you can really grasp how nice it is to walk so peacefully.</p>\n<h2>Tips</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Foodcourts (gathering of stalls serving a few different meals each) are everywhere. Some of them can be a bit dodgy — you will have a rating on each stall, from C to A. From what I've understood, even a A is not necessarily clean. However, I never got sick (but I never tried a C either).</li>\n<li>Grab a tourist SIM at the airport (you'll need your passport as a foreigner). For a cheap 12 SGD (~8 EUR), you'll get 100GB of data for 7 days. <a href=\"https://www.m1.com.sg/Mobile/prepaid-plans/tourist-sim\">I recommend the M1 plans</a> - for iPhone users, you can also get one as an eSim.</li>\n<li>You can manage without cash, but still, I would recommend to withdraw 20-40 SGD for a week to eat in the cheap foodcourts (many of them don't accept credit cards). As a Singaporean, I don't think it's as necessary thanks to other types of payments (like <a href=\"https://www.nets.com.sg\">Nets</a>), but for a tourist, you'll find yourself blocked if you don't have a little bit of cash. This is a surprise, because there are <strong>so many</strong> payment methods available everywhere.</li>\n<li>You don't need to buy city transport tickets (subway or bus). Just use your contactless credit card at the entries and exits, and you'll be debited at the end of the month (or week, I don't really know) automatically. This is so handy.</li>\n<li>Taxis are cheap. Going from the airport to the city center is like 20 SGD (14 EUR). In some places, you'll find one really easily, but it's not always the case at certain moments of the day. There are some applications to do that, but it seemed a bit of a pain to use as a foreigner.</li>\n<li>Restaurants don't show the final prices in the menus. You'll have to add some taxes at the end (I would say around 15%-20%). I'm not sure it's everywhere, but it happens often.</li>\n<li>I never tipped for anything. I didn't feel like I was supposed to. Which is nice<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup>.</li>\n<li>Meals can vary a lot in price. In the foodcourts, you can usually find something around 4 SGD (2.5 EUR). In \"normal\" restaurants, it's more around 15-25 SGD. But it can also be way higher.</li>\n<li>The Singaporean Dollar is very interesting for us Europeans (1 SGD is around 0.66 EUR). It reduces the costs significantly at the time of this writing. Life is not cheap in Singapore, so this helps.</li>\n<li>Buy some Tiger Balms. You can find the white and red for 3-5 SGD (2-3 EUR) each. Which is 4-5 times cheaper than in France.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Places</h2>\n<p>Some places I went to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Marina Bay Sands</strong>: the 3-towers skyscraper with a \"boat\" at the top, and probably the most famous building in Singapore. I went to \"Cé La Vi\" rooftop, which has a nice view on Gardens By The Bay. Go to the mall nearby (The Shoppe at Marina Bay Sands) to climb to the Skydeck and watch the light show during the evening. The ArtScience Museum is a pretty building too.</li>\n<li><strong>Buddha Tooth Relic Temple</strong>: a brand new Buddhist temple that does not look new. The interior is really nice, and there's an interesting museum inside.</li>\n<li><strong>Chinatown</strong>: very nice neighbourhood with lots of restaurants, close to the previous temple.</li>\n<li><strong>Thian Hock Keng Temple</strong>: this temple is surrounded by skyscrapers in a moody district to walk in.</li>\n<li><strong>Gardens By The Bay</strong>: a park near the CBD, with artificial supertrees (the skyway at the top of the tree gives a nice view around) and two domes to visit. I really love this place. It's unique. There's also a great foodcourt in the park called \"Satay By The Bay\".</li>\n<li><strong>Jewel</strong>: it's an artificial park in the center of the airport. They built a huge fountain coming from the ceiling… it's crazy and superb at the same time.</li>\n<li><strong>Zoo</strong>: I wouldn't recommend this. My trip and safaris in Tanzania have probably destroyed any interest I could have in a zoo.</li>\n<li><strong>Haw Par Villa</strong>: it's a bit outside the city center. It was designed by the family who invented the Tiger Balm onguent. Creepy as hell<sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a href=\"#fn-5\" class=\"footnote-ref\">5</a></sup>, but worth a visit.</li>\n<li><strong>Botanic Gardens</strong>: a big park loved by Singopereans and families. It's ok.</li>\n<li><strong>Southern Ridges</strong>: a long walk in the south of the city. I started from Kent Ridges until the Harbourfront MRT station. The section between Kent Ridges to Alexandra Arch is boring. The part after Henderson Waves (to the MRT station) is not interesting either. <em>But from Alexandra Arch (included) and Henderson Waves (included), it's really great.</em></li>\n<li><strong>CBD</strong> and <strong>Lau Pau Sat</strong>: a famous foodcourt in the CBD (Central Business District), surrounded by high towers and business(wo)men.</li>\n<li><strong>1-Altitude</strong>: one of the highest tower with a rooftop. Panoramic view of Singapore.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are many other places I still need to do (Little India, Pulau Ubin, a few temples, MacRichie, etc.). And I still didn't try a Kaya toast breakfast… That will be for another time!</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>Just try a Chicken Rice or black or white Chai Tow Kway (Carrot Cake) if you want something \"typical\".</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>In an interesting way, I would compare the city to Montréal during the winter - you can navigate almost exclusively in man-built structure to avoid the harsh weather, but in Singapore, it will be from the heat, not the cold and snow.

Combining poorly written stuff with more poorly written stuff goes strictly against that. To progress, we need to understand what and why are we doing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm also guilty of that. Look, this website uses <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\">Gatsby</a> to generate a few static pages, and this requires 242M of dependencies to build it (not run it, hopefully).</p>\n<p>However, the result is extremely fast and satisfying for the user, and the developer experience is top-notch, at the expense of an increase in size of the exported bundle on initial (and uncached) load. Is this a reasonable tradeoff?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>At the end:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Business won’t care. Neither will users. They are only learned to expect what we can provide. We (engineers) say every Android app takes 350 MB? Ok, they’ll live with that. We say we can’t give them smooth scrolling? Ok, they’ll live with a phone that stutter. We say “if it doesn’t work, reboot”? They’ll reboot. After all, they have no choice.</p>\n<p>There’s no competition either. Everybody is building the same slow, bloated, unreliable products. Occasional jump forward in quality does bring competitive advantage (iPhone/iOS vs other smartphones, Chrome vs other browsers) and forces everybody to regroup, but not for long.</p>\n<p>So it’s our mission as engineers to show the world what’s possible with today’s computers in terms of performance, reliability, quality, usability. If we care, people will learn. And there’s nobody but us to show them that it’s very much possible. If only we care.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On this, I don't completely agree. Yes, in general, people are mostly stuck with what we provide, but users are way too forgiving, and most of the time, don't even see the quality problem<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> — only a fraction perceives it.<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup> Even engineers working on products don't necessarily see that something's wrong. How many engineers don't care about design, visual consistency, coherence, and speed, for example?<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup> How many don't see that their users are struggling?</p>\n<p>But there's a choice to be made by users: choose carefully, invest and learn, accept to spend a bit more on something better and more durable, change less often, and don't restrict yourself to the most ugly and cheap solution all the time, just because that was the first and easy choice.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>That's a shame and such a waste, though. I don't know if we can do better with our current tools.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>Case in point: Windows is still a complete mess — the average bar of software quality on this platform is abysmal, and most people are completely okay with that — they don't even care. The only thing that raised the bar on Windows is Electron apps, and these came with their own set of tradeoffs, and are almost universally considered as subpar and second-tier citizens on other OSes. <em>It's a vicious cycle: if the platform owner doesn't care, the developers won't care, thus the users too.</em></p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-3\">\n<p>This, though, poses another question: should we care about high quality if it doesn't matter for 80% of the users? I do think we should and I'm happy we still have craftsmanship in this world, but maybe it's only us, designers and nerds, that spend too much time pondering about that.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-4\">\n<p>And it's a bit easy to say this without knowing the business constraints.
