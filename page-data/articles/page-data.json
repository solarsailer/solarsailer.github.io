Robinson. The article is called ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2022/05/why-this-computer-scientist-says-all-cryptocurrency-should-die-in-a-fire/\">Why This Computer Scientist Says All Cryptocurrency Should ‚ÄúDie in a Fire‚Äù</a>‚Äù, and, as you can guess, is not really gentle with cryptocurrencies and the blockchain in general.</p>\n<p>The interview talks about many topics and is really interesting. Here's a few passages I enjoyed.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Starting with Nicholas Weaver, in 2018:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cryptocurrencies, although a seemingly interesting idea, are simply not fit for purpose. <strong>They do not work as currencies, they are grossly inefficient, and they are not meaningfully distributed in terms of trust.</strong> Risks involving cryptocurrencies occur in four major areas: technical risks to participants, economic risks to participants, systemic risks to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and societal risks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Briefly quoted in the article, Jackson Palmer, creator of Dogecoin:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After years of studying it, I believe that cryptocurrency is an inherently right-wing, hyper-capitalistic technology built primarily to amplify the wealth of its proponents through a combination of tax avoidance, diminished regulatory oversight, and artificially enforced scarcity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In an exchange later in the article:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Robinson</strong>: ‚ÄúI am sure you have heard people say things like ‚ÄúWell, blockchain technology itself has lots of potential applications, it‚Äôs really interesting, offers lots of possible solutions to problems.‚Äù But one thing you point out in your lecture is that often, they are pretty vague about what these uses are, and usually when you get down to the facts, there‚Äôs a much simpler solution to whatever problem it is that wouldn‚Äôt use blockchain.‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>Weaver</strong>: ‚ÄúThe thing is, the idea behind a blockchain is actually a 30-plus-year-old idea. It‚Äôs called a hash chain. And we‚Äôve known how to build these for longer than most of my students have lived. But people who spout ‚ÄúBlockchain!‚Äù don‚Äôt understand the technology. [‚Ä¶] <strong>When somebody says you can solve X with blockchain, they don‚Äôt understand X, and you can ignore them.</strong>‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Illustrated in this illuminating example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So, this was an example given by a purported expert in a blockchain class at Berkeley: ‚ÄúOkay, we have the cold chain problem. Vaccines, you need to ship cold, and if they ever get out of temperature spec, you have a ruined batch. And we can solve this with blockchain.‚Äù</p>\n<p>And my reaction is: ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. The problem is you need to know when it got out of spec, and know that the receiver can know that it had gotten out of spec. And there‚Äôs an easy solution. It‚Äôs called a $1 ShockWatch label. So the ShockWatch group makes these temperature labels. You stick them on the package. And if it ever gets too warm, the color changes. No blockchain necessary.</p>\n<p><em>The fact that somebody was purporting this to be a real-world application meant they had not even thought about the problem for five seconds.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In another exchange:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Robinson</strong>: ‚ÄúOne of the things you‚Äôve said, if I recall, is that the cryptocurrency space is ‚Äúspeed-running 500 years of financial history.‚Äù By which I take you to mean that all of the financial disasters of centuries past are playing out in short order, and then they have to rediscover the solutions that were put in place for those things not to happen.‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>Weaver</strong>: ‚ÄúYeah. [‚Ä¶] The thing is, though, the cryptocurrency space itself has the object permanence of a horny mayfly. <em>They simply don‚Äôt remember their own scams.</em>‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, Nicholas Weaver, concluding the interview:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That‚Äôs the problem, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve actually changed my view over the past decade. Back in 2013, I thought it was amusing and silly, and I could get cool papers out of it. In 2018, I thought it was amusing, but pretty bad. [In 2022], it‚Äôs time to really think about burning it down. Now I just want to take the entire cryptocurrency space and throw it into the sun. I know astronomers will tell you it‚Äôs easier to throw something into the void of space than to throw it into the sun.

[‚Ä¶]</p>\n<p>Let's say it takes 10.000 iterations to make a product great. You have to keep polishing, to keep refining and it takes around 10.000 iterations. <strong>The whole point is: how fast can you do each iteration?</strong></p>\n<p>At my previous company [dealing with security software, bank, government, etc.] <em>it would literally take a year and a half to do an iteration</em>. [You were making] some software, [sell it to an entity], deploy it, [deal with pilots], have a formal feedback. If it's gonna take a year and a half to make improvements to the product and you need to make 10.000 iterations, it's <strong>fifteen thousand years</strong> to make a great product. You just don't have this kind of time.</p>\n<p>At Evernote [‚Ä¶] an iteration was twenty minutes, because we would just make something ‚Äî and then, if we were honest with ourselves ‚Äî, we could say \"does this feel better or worse than it did twenty minutes ago?\". And so, by having this really fast, really tight iteration loops [‚Ä¶] we could just move really really quickly. <strong>We could make a product pretty good faster than I ever thought possible before.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And, as a consequence, the time to make a product <em>great</em> (not just \"pretty good\") is also reduced.</p>\n<p>One note though: we need to be careful not to confuse \"speed of iteration\" with \"velocity\".</p>\n<p>\"Iteration\" is your ability to experiment and refine a feature. You can iterate a lot but just release a very few impactful features (which is good). To the contrary, you can iterate slowly and output a lof of very low value, unpolished and mediocre features.<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>Speed of iteration is important.<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup> Meaningless velocity is not. It's more debt, it's harder to maintain, and it results in more complex products for users.</p>\n<p>See ‚Äú<a href=\"https://itamargilad.com/velocity-vs-impact/\">Stop Obsessing Over Development Velocity, Focus on This Instead</a>‚Äù for a good \"factual\" overview.</p>\n<h2>User feedback</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"transcript\">\n<p>It isn't so much that we didn't listen to our users. We listened to our users very carefully but in a very specific way. We listened to how they were reacting to what we were putting in front of them. We <strong>weren't</strong> asking them about what they wanted. [‚Ä¶]</p>\n<p>If you ask users what they want, they are not gonna tell you what they want because they don't know. <strong>Very few people can articulate and have the power of imagination to envision what they actually want.</strong></p>\n<p>If you ask customers or prospective customers what they want, they'll tell you the stuff that they expect‚Ä¶ and <em>very rarely will that actually be what they want</em>. [Then, he quotes Henry Ford famous line: ‚ÄúIf I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.‚Äù]. We don't ask customers what they want, we ask customers to respond to what we are giving them. Because then, it's much more useful: you can tell when people are confused, when they are happy, when they are satisfied and then we can decide who to ignore, which opinion to take seriously, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is one of the topics I'm coming back to frequently in my job.</p>\n<p>How can you gather as much feedback as possible, while not becoming crushed by its weight or clients' expectations?</p>\n<p>Moreover, collecting the feedback is only one side of the coin (and the easy one). The second side is <em>how to digest it properly</em>. There, you discover that the product manager's toolkit is, unfortunately, very empty.<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>Users feedback are <em>critically important insights</em>, but it should be seen as an additional knowledge base for future decisions and hypotheses. Not as something you must respond to ‚Äî or worse, act on ‚Äî constantly.<sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a href=\"#fn-5\" class=\"footnote-ref\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>See also ‚Äú<a href=\"https://linear.app/method/build-with-users\">Build with users</a>‚Äù from the Linear method.</p>\n<h2>Building the right set of functionalities</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"transcript\">\n<p>[About Evernote] I think we just did too much stuff. There's always this balance of ‚Äúwhat's the right amount of focus?‚Äù.</p>\n<p>It's hard to know in the moment‚Ä¶ you can only do that in hindsight ‚Äî if you succeed, you had the right amount of focus. If you don't, then you are either doing too much stuff, and you didn't have that focus, or not enough stuff, and you weren't thinking big enough or whatever.</p>\n<p>We always struggle with that balance. What is too much to build and what is just the right amount? How do we know? [‚Ä¶] In hindsight, I would have worked for longer on some specific things before moving on to introduce [new features].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This reminds me of a comment made by a candidate during an interview: <em>‚ÄúOne crucial part of a product manager's job is not about which features should be included, but which one should be removed or ignored‚Äù</em> (paraphrasing).</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>I slightly edited Phil Libin's speech to make it more readable in a written form. Emphasis is also mine.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">‚Ü©</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>Unfortunately, most agile teams using Scrum are optimised toward extreme-velocity instead of their ability to experiment and iterate quickly.

It's also why the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII\"><em>development pipeline loop</em></a> should be as short as possible, between typing the code and observing the results.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">‚Ü©</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-4\">\n<p>I've searched for many, <em>many</em> tools to handle feedback. I didn't find one that was 100% satisfying. At this point, I'm considering there is no \"right\" solution to this problem.</p>\n<p>  The most adequate tool is probably a generic data-visualisation or log processing platform like Kibana or Datadog. Tools that were not conceived for this problem specifically, but instead to digest, process, present and search raw data in quantity. Which is what user feedback is: information logs, but provided by users instead of machines.</p>\n<p>  See it similarly to an analytics tool: you would consult the platform everyday to have an overview of your users, how they feel about your product, and what they expect. Use that as additional data for experiments and ideas. When you look at analytics, you don't act immediately, and you cannot answer questions there. You use this trove of data to refine your hypotheses. Feedback should be seen the same way.</p>\n<p>  Using this approach would also remove the emotion from the equation. It would allow the product manager to take a step back and look at all this knowledge objectively‚Ä¶ like analytics.</p>\n<p>  And for qualitative measures?
