[…]</p>\n<p>I often think about the benefits of automation in the context of time savings. It makes things more efficient, removes drudgery. But I’ve realized over time that the <em>real</em> benefit of automation is avoiding mistakes.</p>\n<p>When I automate something (anything), I’m defining the steps that need to be included to complete the task. I’m no longer relying on my memory to ensure that every step is complete or the specific ways in which a step should be completed. This is especially useful if it’s something I don’t do very often […] if it helps me do the exact same thing one time a year later, that’s often worth as much as any amount of total time saved in my life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Exactly!</strong> Avoiding mistakes is much more important than any time-saving<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>. Automation removes the need to remember what you need to do, and simplify the sharing of knowledge. It's basically a <em>self-fulfilling <a href=\"http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/\">checklist</a></em> that can be triggered by anybody.</p>\n<p>Let me digress a bit with a few examples and principles. I'm by no mean perfect, but this is how I'm trying to improve.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When I was developing a new website for <a href=\"https://pixelnest.io/\">Pixelnest Studio</a>, the first step was setuping the project, and automating the deployment, so that I could come back 6 months later and still be able to deploy easily without reading the README or the code.</p>\n<p>For <a href=\"http://steredenn.pixelnest.io\">Steredenn</a>, I created a lot of scripts to automate the release pipeline (building the game, packaging it, creating the different changelogs for the multiple platforms, etc.). This took me a non-negligible amount of time, but when I needed to do a new release after a long hiatus, it was a breeze and such a relief. Bonus: my associate could also do it in case I was not here, without having to dive in the code or knowing the full process.<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> In the game itself, <a href=\"https://dmayance.com/\">Damien</a> spent time creating little tools and helpers to go to a specific part of the game easily, so we could test different configurations and situations at will. <em>The result? A better, more stable game. Less mistakes. More time.</em></p>\n<p>I maintain a personal repository with <a href=\"https://github.com/solarsailer/dotfiles/\">most of my non-app scripts</a> on GitHub, and one of my most treasured part is a procedure to boostrap a new macOS installation in a semi-automated fashion. I don't do that often, but I know that I can confidently reproduce a new environment (in case of loss or theft) without a lot of struggle.</p>\n<p>I tried to put most of the settings of my apps (Alfred, iTerm2, Dash, etc.) on a cloud provider, so that I can share them between computers and have a backup (it's actually one of my selection criteria when I try a new tool — \"can I sync the settings easily?\"). The tools are tailored to my use, and I don't have to customize them again.</p>\n<p>I automated and documented our servers installation so that I could nuke and reinstantiate them easily. I'm not an experienced sysadmin at all, so having this ability to restart from scratch was a godsend to me.</p>\n<p>It's not pure automation, but it falls in the same ballpark for me. <strong>It's emptying your brain so that you can focus on what you care.</strong> <em>And, bonus, it's fun to do!</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>As a different example: I scan and store all my documents online (pro or perso). When I'm asked for something (passport? last phone bill?), I take my phone, get the document and send it or print it directly.</p>\n<p>It's a really simple process: when I receive a paper, I quickly look at the document, <em>decide if I keep it or not</em> (if not, it's direct in the trash), then launch Scanbot, OCR it and boom it's stored in the right place. It has just become automatic for me now. It takes me literally 10s. And this has saved me so. much. time, as well as prevented the loss of important stuffs. <em>It would have been easier to just put that doc on a shelf and never care about it anymore</em>, sure. But then, when you search for a new flat, and need to find those twenty docs, you will thank yourself.</p>\n<p>It was <strong>always more effort initially</strong>, and we, humans, don't like effort. <em>But being a good slacker is not about doing nothing, it's actually doing more at the beginning, so you can do less later.</em> And that's what computers are good at too!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>That's also a reason why I love checklists so much. <strong>Checklists are the manual version of automation</strong>: you write it, you duplicate it, you cross it, and you forget it.</p>\n<p>Checklists are <em>also cheap and easy-to-write documentation</em> — for you, your family, your friends, your coworkers.</p>\n<p>You go on a trip? Write your packing checklist. Quickly scan it before leaving a place — you won't lose anything.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I would dare to go further.</p>\n<p>In computing (and life in general), there are a few principles that I consider extremely important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Repeatability</strong>: repeat a task in a predictable manner and efficiently without dreading it;</li>\n<li><strong>Robustness</strong>: ensure you are doing the right steps and actions all the time, consistently;</li>\n<li><strong>Shareability</strong>: share information painlessly with other people, and more importantly, your future-self;<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup></li>\n<li><strong>Mastery</strong>: learn your tools, the shortcuts, and the customization points. Dive in the menus, try everything. This is physical automation: you train your body to repeat stuffs quickly without thinking about it.<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup> You save time, you reduce mistakes, you get better;</li>\n<li><strong>Documentability</strong>: enrich your knowledge base constantly - that is vitally important. Document what you do and why.<sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a href=\"#fn-5\" class=\"footnote-ref\">5</a></sup> Take notes, create a task in your todo apps to not forget something important. Offload your mind and find any information in no time.<sup id=\"fnref-6\"><a href=\"#fn-6\" class=\"footnote-ref\">6</a></sup></li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's automation, although at a bigger scope than just plain computer automation and scripting.

It's a way for me to be consistent, coherent, efficient and meticulous. To care about what I do without putting more charge on me.</p>\n<p><em>And to be able to <strong>lose my time</strong> on the areas where it provides me joy.</em></p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>Which is still a really nice perk — we shouldn't diminish that property.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>Don't get me wrong: it was not perfect. Some steps were still manual and I could have automated them, but there's a point where a good ol' checklist is enough and automating becomes a burden. However, if it's manual, <strong>it needs to be documented</strong>. Hence, generally, a checklist.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-3\">\n<p>That can be a script, a documentation, or a process. That's why, when I find an important information, I store it ASAP in my Dropbox so I can come back to it later. That's also why I'm blogging: to keep the relevant articles I found right at my fingertips. That's, finally, why I love scripting: I don't want to memorize how I need to execute an action — it's more mistakes later, and less predictability. It's also a source of examples for future-me.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-4\">\n<p>That's why automation-freaks enjoy <a href=\"https://textexpander.com/\">text expansion</a> so much.

Here's another: when you have a company in France, you need to do something called \"l'approbation des comptes\" every year. It's boring, complex, and prone to mistakes. The first time I did it, I noted all the steps I needed to do while I was learning to do it. The next year, it — obviously — happened again, and I didn't have any clue about what I did. I remembered taking the notes, look at them, and in almost no time, was able to do it again. I could have learned once more, but this would have been a big waste a time, and a big chore.

It's when you go back home that you can really grasp how nice it is to walk so peacefully.</p>\n<h2>Tips</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Foodcourts (gathering of stalls serving a few different meals each) are everywhere. Some of them can be a bit dodgy — you will have a rating on each stall, from C to A. From what I've understood, even a A is not necessarily clean. However, I never got sick (but I never tried a C either).</li>\n<li>Grab a tourist SIM at the airport (you'll need your passport as a foreigner). For a cheap 12 SGD (~8 EUR), you'll get 100GB of data for 7 days. <a href=\"https://www.m1.com.sg/Mobile/prepaid-plans/tourist-sim\">I recommend the M1 plans</a> - for iPhone users, you can also get one as an eSim.</li>\n<li>You can manage without cash, but still, I would recommend to withdraw 20-40 SGD for a week to eat in the cheap foodcourts (many of them don't accept credit cards). As a Singaporean, I don't think it's as necessary thanks to other types of payments (like <a href=\"https://www.nets.com.sg\">Nets</a>), but for a tourist, you'll find yourself blocked if you don't have a little bit of cash. This is a surprise, because there are <strong>so many</strong> payment methods available everywhere.</li>\n<li>You don't need to buy city transport tickets (subway or bus). Just use your contactless credit card at the entries and exits, and you'll be debited at the end of the month (or week, I don't really know) automatically. This is so handy.</li>\n<li>Taxis are cheap. Going from the airport to the city center is like 20 SGD (14 EUR). In some places, you'll find one really easily, but it's not always the case at certain moments of the day. There are some applications to do that, but it seemed a bit of a pain to use as a foreigner.</li>\n<li>Restaurants don't show the final prices in the menus. You'll have to add some taxes at the end (I would say around 15%-20%). I'm not sure it's everywhere, but it happens often.</li>\n<li>I never tipped for anything. I didn't feel like I was supposed to. Which is nice<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup>.</li>\n<li>Meals can vary a lot in price. In the foodcourts, you can usually find something around 4 SGD (2.5 EUR). In \"normal\" restaurants, it's more around 15-25 SGD. But it can also be way higher.</li>\n<li>The Singaporean Dollar is very interesting for us Europeans (1 SGD is around 0.66 EUR). It reduces the costs significantly at the time of this writing. Life is not cheap in Singapore, so this helps.</li>\n<li>Buy some Tiger Balms. You can find the white and red for 3-5 SGD (2-3 EUR) each. Which is 4-5 times cheaper than in France.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Places</h2>\n<p>Some places I went to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Marina Bay Sands</strong>: the 3-towers skyscraper with a \"boat\" at the top, and probably the most famous building in Singapore. I went to \"Cé La Vi\" rooftop, which has a nice view on Gardens By The Bay. Go to the mall nearby (The Shoppe at Marina Bay Sands) to climb to the Skydeck and watch the light show during the evening. The ArtScience Museum is a pretty building too.</li>\n<li><strong>Buddha Tooth Relic Temple</strong>: a brand new Buddhist temple that does not look new. The interior is really nice, and there's an interesting museum inside.</li>\n<li><strong>Chinatown</strong>: very nice neighbourhood with lots of restaurants, close to the previous temple.</li>\n<li><strong>Thian Hock Keng Temple</strong>: this temple is surrounded by skyscrapers in a moody district to walk in.</li>\n<li><strong>Gardens By The Bay</strong>: a park near the CBD, with artificial supertrees (the skyway at the top of the tree gives a nice view around) and two domes to visit. I really love this place. It's unique. There's also a great foodcourt in the park called \"Satay By The Bay\".</li>\n<li><strong>Jewel</strong>: it's an artificial park in the center of the airport. They built a huge fountain coming from the ceiling… it's crazy and superb at the same time.</li>\n<li><strong>Zoo</strong>: I wouldn't recommend this. My trip and safaris in Tanzania have probably destroyed any interest I could have in a zoo.</li>\n<li><strong>Haw Par Villa</strong>: it's a bit outside the city center. It was designed by the family who invented the Tiger Balm onguent. Creepy as hell<sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a href=\"#fn-5\" class=\"footnote-ref\">5</a></sup>, but worth a visit.</li>\n<li><strong>Botanic Gardens</strong>: a big park loved by Singopereans and families. It's ok.</li>\n<li><strong>Southern Ridges</strong>: a long walk in the south of the city. I started from Kent Ridges until the Harbourfront MRT station. The section between Kent Ridges to Alexandra Arch is boring. The part after Henderson Waves (to the MRT station) is not interesting either. <em>But from Alexandra Arch (included) and Henderson Waves (included), it's really great.</em></li>\n<li><strong>CBD</strong> and <strong>Lau Pau Sat</strong>: a famous foodcourt in the CBD (Central Business District), surrounded by high towers and business(wo)men.</li>\n<li><strong>1-Altitude</strong>: one of the highest tower with a rooftop. Panoramic view of Singapore.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are many other places I still need to do (Little India, Pulau Ubin, a few temples, MacRichie, etc.). And I still didn't try a Kaya toast breakfast… That will be for another time!</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>Just try a Chicken Rice or black or white Chai Tow Kway (Carrot Cake) if you want something \"typical\".</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>In an interesting way, I would compare the city to Montréal during the winter - you can navigate almost exclusively in man-built structure to avoid the harsh weather, but in Singapore, it will be from the heat, not the cold and snow.

If we were more thoughtful with what we build, it could be possible, but to keep a sane and manageable codebase in our current world, we need to accept that we will lose compatibility and devices over time.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That is not engineering.

Look, this website uses <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\">Gatsby</a> to generate a few static pages, and this requires 242M of dependencies to build it (not run it, hopefully).</p>\n<p>However, the result is extremely fast and satisfying for the user, and the developer experience is top-notch, at the expense of an increase in size of the exported bundle on initial (and uncached) load. Is this a reasonable tradeoff?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>At the end:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Business won’t care. Neither will users. They are only learned to expect what we can provide. We (engineers) say every Android app takes 350 MB? Ok, they’ll live with that. We say we can’t give them smooth scrolling? Ok, they’ll live with a phone that stutter. We say “if it doesn’t work, reboot”? They’ll reboot. After all, they have no choice.</p>\n<p>There’s no competition either. Everybody is building the same slow, bloated, unreliable products. Occasional jump forward in quality does bring competitive advantage (iPhone/iOS vs other smartphones, Chrome vs other browsers) and forces everybody to regroup, but not for long.</p>\n<p>So it’s our mission as engineers to show the world what’s possible with today’s computers in terms of performance, reliability, quality, usability. If we care, people will learn. And there’s nobody but us to show them that it’s very much possible. If only we care.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On this, I don't completely agree. Yes, in general, people are mostly stuck with what we provide, but users are way too forgiving, and most of the time, don't even see the quality problem<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> — only a fraction perceives it.<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup> Even engineers working on products don't necessarily see that something's wrong.
