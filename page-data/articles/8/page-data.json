Ironically, even a lot of developers who work in big companies don't want to pay for softwares.</p>\n<p>The mobile apps markets have made this situation worse.</p>\n<p>I'm currently thinking back about the mobile market, especially for games. At a time, I thought that going mobile-only was the best shot today, but the more I think about it, the more I'm realizing that a platform like Steam (which also drives the prices to the bottom, alas) is more sustainable for a developer/company.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.marco.org/2013/09/28/underscore-price-dynamics\">Marco Arment</a> said in its latest blog post: <em>\"Paid-up-front iOS apps had a great run, but it’s over. Time to make other plans.\"</em>.</p>\n<p>So what does that leave? Freemium? Unfortunately, freemium almost always goes with <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/candy-crush-saga/id553834731?mt=8\">bad apps or games that trick users to pay for more</a>.</p>\n<p>N.B.: To be clear, as a user, I'm happy to <em>pay less</em>. For almost everybody, a software or a game at 50-100$ is way too high, and that's fine. What I don't like is that we are now in a situation where  even one buck for an app you use daily is too much. <strong>One buck per app cannot sustain a one-person business.</strong></p>"}},{"node":{"id":"8679eb42-49e6-5a96-a299-b98cd0762fe2","frontmatter":{"path":null,"title":"Patent Trolls","date":"2013-09-17","readableDate":"17 September 2013","redirectFrom":null,"excerpt":"I'm not against patents and inventors' rights.

I am not writing about brand design, but about brand management. This is about a simple rule: Brand design follows brand management, not the other way around.</p>\n<p>One could argue that we can’t say if this is bad brand management. Unless we know what the brand ambition, the brand architecture, and the brand strategy is, we ought to have no opinion. Maybe the logo does exactly what it is supposed to do. Because really, it doesn’t matter whether it looks pretty, or whether someone likes or dislikes the purple or the scallops. The Coca-Cola logo was not designed by a professional designer, it is typographically hideous, but that doesn’t matter. Brand identity is not about visual refinement or aesthetics. It can be purposely ugly, like the London Olympics logo. What is important is that it is done seriously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(By the way, I'm still amazed by the quality of the iA website, and especially the blog. Typography, details, everything.
