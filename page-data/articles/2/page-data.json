This is <em>the most important</em> thing. Noise must be low during the \"networking phase\", which means that the venue should not produce too much sound acoustically (and if it's not possible, simply reduce the number of people attending your event). People should be able to talk to each other at more than 20cm away after a talk. I can't count the number of times I approached a group, finding that I couldn't hear one single word because the room was too loud.</li>\n<li><strong>Get 3 mics</strong> at least. One for the moderator, one for the speaker (or group of speakers), and one for the audience. The audience also wants to listen to the questions. The speaker or moderator should repeat the question after hearing it anyways, but this common practice is often forgotten, unfortunately.</li>\n<li><strong>Fresh air access</strong>. This is more for conferences, since meetups are usually shorter. There's nothing worse than not being able to go outside for a few minutes every hour. Headaches and odors await otherwise.</li>\n<li><strong>Find ways to nudge people to talk to each other</strong>. There will be groups of people that know each other, so the task is, by default, harder for strangers. Give them help, find ways to make interaction more natural. It's not that hard, I think (but it depends on the venue and what your event is about). For conferences, what I like is when other activities are offered (games for examples) — it's good to have breaks. And many times you can meet new people more easily in a different setup.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce</strong>. <strong>The</strong>. <strong>Number</strong>. <strong>Of</strong>. <strong>Attendees</strong>. I get it that organizers don't want a small number of people at their meetups or conferences. It's not as profitable and it's not as good for the press/reputation, but participants will thank you. 1) It helps people talking to each other after a talk. 2) It reduces noise. 3) It creates intimacy and makes people ask more questions to the speakers. 4) And, in fact, it reduces your cost and makes everything more manageable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There're many other things to do, but these are my main frustrations. For the rest, the talk linked above is excellent! :)</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"23b0e901-3eaa-5cb4-beea-316c55254ab3","frontmatter":{"path":null,"title":"Tools","date":"2018-12-05","readableDate":"05 December 2018","redirectFrom":null,"excerpt":null,"excerptQuote":{"name":"Blood, Sweat and Pixels","quote":"That's what tool are.

You have to swipe from the bottom of the screen, which puts the app back inside its icon.</p>\n<p>By default, at the bottom (where the chin was), the home indicator is <strong>always visible</strong> in an app. It's the black bar you can see on this screenshot:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/home-indicator.jpg\" alt=\"Home indicator default state\"></p>\n<p>For the moment, it's a permanent indicator if the app does not specify a different behavior.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>See what it does in action:</p>\n<figure>\n  <video src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/action.mp4\" width=\"221.5\" height=\"480\" controls muted loop>\n    Your browser doesn't support videos.

With the haptic feedback, it's actually very nice to play with.</p>\n<h2>Changing the behavior in Unity</h2>\n<p>However, this (default) behavior is not great for games. It's too bright and it hides a small portion of the bottom part of the screen. Which can be confusing in games like Steredenn, where many things are displayed at the same time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/steredenn.jpg\" alt=\"Home indicator in Steredenn\"></p>\n<p>Fortunately, Unity (well, technically, it's iOS) provides 2 ways to change the home indicator. Obviously with Unity, the correct one is not the one you would expect.</p>\n<p>You can find these settings by following this procedure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <code class=\"language-text\">Edit → Project Settings → Player</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/unity-01.jpg\" alt=\"Open the Player&#x27;s settings\"></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Then, click on the iOS tab, and find the \"Other Settings\" area.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/unity-02.jpg\" alt=\"Find &#x22;Other Settings&#x22;\"></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Finally, we are interested in 2 settings: \"Hide home button on iPhone X\" and \"Defer system gestures on edges\".</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/unity-03.jpg\" alt=\"&#x22;Hide home button on iPhone X&#x22; and &#x22;Defer system gestures on edges&#x22;\"></p>\n<h2>\"Hide home button on iPhone X\"</h2>\n<p>\"Hide home button on iPhone X\", the one that looks like what we want, is, of course, the <em>wrong one</em>.</p>\n<p>This setting hides the home indicator after a certain inactivity delay. If the user taps on the screen, the home indicator appears again in its full bright glory. In a game, where you will tap all the time, it's the same as showing the indicator permanently.</p>\n<p>Note that this setting can be useful sometimes. For example, if you are doing a video player, or a game that does not require user inputs often, this is what you want. I think there is ways to toggle this behavior when needed.</p>\n<p>This is what YouTube does, for example (it's hard to see cos' the home indicator is black here, but look at the bottom):</p>\n<figure>\n  <video src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/hide.mp4\" controls muted loop>\n    Your browser doesn't support videos.

Perfect.</li>\n<li>To go back to the home screen, you have to do the gesture twice. This is also nice, since it prevents accidental gestures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The \"bottom\" checkbox is enough if you only want to change the home indicator behavior. The other checkboxes can be used for Control Center and other gestures on iPad, I think.</p>\n<p>This is what Alto's Adventure does, as well as Steredenn:</p>\n<figure>\n  <video src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/defer.mp4\" controls muted loop>\n    Your browser doesn't support videos.

First, I noticed the packaging. Unlike the high-quality large-format cardboard boxes with soft colors and thoughtful art, GTR came in a compact, cheap, plastic tub that wasn’t much bigger than a large paperback book. Second, and more jarring, was the game's art. It had a bright color palette and cartoonish characters that seemed like they belonged in a children’s clip art computer game.</p>\n<p>[He] started unpacking the game and patiently explaining the rules. What immediately struck me was the mechanic allowing the player to choose what type any given card would be—one of a few choices that would automatically exclude the others. GTR appeared to be full of intrigue and strategy, and there were multiple ways to win. […]</p>\n<p>In less than a decade, how could a game whose ranking still remains relatively high (150) on Board Game Geek — just a few places above Magic: The Gathering and a few places lower than Carcassonne — have totally disappeared? What happened? […]</p>\n<p>\"It’s one of those games, you just recognize the genius of the design of it,\" Lozito told Ars. \"This is one of the quintessential big games in a small box. Every time you sit down to play it it plays differently, the cards are all crazy. I looked at the game and I have no idea how his brain could come up with such a complex game out of 125 cards or whatever.\" […]</p>\n<p>As GTR continued to gather critical and cult-classic steam, word started getting back to [co-creator Carter] that one of the game’s primary problems was its awful production—those nausea-inducing colors and a cheap plastic box. […]</p>\n<p>[After the Kickstarter's success], this should have been the moment that Carter seized game-design glory. With a successful production, he could have taken the game from indie cult favorite to something much bigger. But according to Rao, this influx of cash instead represented the beginning of the end.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's a description from Ed Carter, one of the \"co-creators\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Early on, Glory To Rome was often called \"San Juan on Steroids,\" but it would probably be more accurate to call it \"San Juan meets Magic The Gathering.\" There are 40 different cards in Glory To Rome and each one has a unique ability. Only four of them are sensible \"Improve your X by Y\" abilities—the rest are ridiculous, convoluted powers like \"Incomplete MARBLE structures provide function.\" That generates 760 different two-card combinations and many thousands of three-card ones. I've played hundreds of games of GTR over the years so I've thought about a lot of these combinations, but certainly not all of them.</p>\n<p>Also, while most games are balanced using a stable equilibrium with the aim that no card should be so overpowering that it breaks the game, Glory To Rome is balanced using astable equilibrium—our aim was that in the right combinations, virtually every card would be able to contribute to a runaway victory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was never aware that the game was unavailable. I got a copy of the French version (by Filosofia) a few years ago when it was in store almost anywhere in France, in a reprinted and decent version, so this story is all news to me. It's funny to think that the game was \"everywhere\" here, but unavailable in its home-country.</p>\n<p>It's a shame though, since the game is really, <em>really</em> great.</p>\n<p><em>Side note: the work by <a href=\"https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/643046/poll-would-you-buy-re-design-glory-rome\">Heiko Günther</a> is beautiful too. I think that the French version is clearer in an actual game, but wow this is pretty.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>This article makes me think that many boardgames disappear each year, going unnoticed and forgotten forever.</p>\n<p>I wrote about <a href=\"https://matthieuoger.com/2015/09/quantum-post-mortem/\">Quantum</a> before, one of my favorite boardgames, which is out of stock too.

The disturbing thing, however, is that most of these games are, actually, great games.</p>\n<p>Only a small and highly-successful portion of all the boardgames will be kept forever (Catan, Race for the Galaxy, Carcassonne, Monopoly, 7 Wonders, etc.).

And when I came back, I just ditched it all. Again. And again. And again.</p>\n<p>I moved the blog to <a href=\"https://gohugo.io\">Hugo</a>. Then I came back to Jekyll once more. I modernized everything. Then I was fed up with Jekyll again, so I tried <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\">Gatsby</a>. And I did other things, abandoning the redesign once again. Meanwhile, and even if I had dozens of drafts, I couldn't update the old blog with new articles. So it languished there, in its infamous uglyness (something I was not proud of, calling myself a <em>designer</em>).</p>\n<p>And finally, I retried Gatsby recently and completed a new design. It's not perfect. It's not well tested on older browsers. But it works, in a good enough way for me — I have already spent too much time on it.</p>\n<p>I've also cut the dependency I had on GitHub Pages. I'm still using GitHub to host this website, but the workflow is separated and I'm free to use what I want.</p>\n<p><strong>It's time to ship.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>More than just a simple redesign, I wanted to reboot the site to add a <strong>portfolio</strong>, a <strong>resume</strong>, a <strong>documentation·codex·tutorials</strong>, as well as a <strong>photo</strong> and <strong>automation</strong> sections. Of course, if I wanted to do it all, I would never have finished anything, so I just focused on a simple redesign at the time being, keeping in mind that the site would be expanded later.</p>\n<p>The goal, in the end, is to do all that — if I'm motivated enough. A good start would be to publish new articles with a regular schedule.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Another thing that was ticking for this website was the \"deprecation\" of <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html\">HTTP by Chrome in an upcoming update</a>. By deprecation, I mean that Chrome will show an \"Unsecure\" flag on non-HTTPS websites. HTTP will always work, but it will be relegated to a legacy protocol that nobody should continue to use.</p>\n<p>I was in a hurry to complete this reboot before this update. I soft-launched the new site a few weeks ago, and tweaked it since. And now it's official.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>To be a little bit exhaustive:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have 6 designs in Sketch files, plus a few more that I did directly in the browser.</li>\n<li>I did more than 50 logos. And I'm still not satisfied by the one I use now (it's not the best that I did, but I think it fits better with the layout and what I wanted to do). It's so hard to capture the essence of something personal. It's a blank canvas without any constraints.</li>\n<li>I tried 4 or 5 blog engines (<a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com\">Jekyll</a>, <a href=\"http://www.metalsmith.io\">Metalsmith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\">Gatsby</a>, <a href=\"https://gohugo.io\">Hugo</a> and others). I even toyed with the idea of creating my own.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm so exhausted by this whole process and that's mainly why I'm so long to end this blog post. 😇</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I hope you'll like it.</p>\n<h2>Update <span class=\"more\">18 October 2018</span></h2>\n<p>I've renamed the site to simply \"Matthieu Oger\". The \"brand\" I was trying to create with the \"Solar Sailer\" name was not working at all. It's better to just drop it and use my name as of now.
