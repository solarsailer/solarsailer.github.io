You’ll worry less, you’ll accept more. “That’s fine” is such a wonderfully relaxing way to work most of the time.

That’s why your company should be your best product. […] That, like product development, progress is achieved through iteration. If you want to make a product better, you have to keep tweaking, revising, and iterating. The same thing is true with a company.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>But when you think of the company as a product, you ask different questions: Do people who work here know how to use the company? Is it simple? Complex? Is it obvious how it works? What’s fast about it? What’s slow about it? Are there bugs? What’s broken that we can fix quickly and what’s going to take a long time?</p>\n<p>A company is like software. It has to be usable, it has to be useful. And it probably also has bugs, places where the company crashes because of bad organizational design or cultural oversights.</p>\n<p>When you start to think about your company as a product, all sorts of new possibilities for improvement emerge. When you realize the way you work is malleable, you can start molding something new, something better.</p>\n</blockquote>"}},{"node":{"id":"703aa303-3068-5f6f-a6ea-a7bdc07722f3","frontmatter":{"path":null,"title":"Withhold the Fun","date":"2019-07-29","readableDate":"29 July 2019","redirectFrom":null,"excerpt":null,"excerptQuote":{"name":"John Siracusa","quote":"We established before the definition of enterprise software, the people who pay for the software and select it are not the people who use it — so your software being more desirable for users means almost nothing in the enterprise."}},"fields":{"path":"/2019/07/withhold-the-fun/","slug":"/2019/07/withhold-the-fun/"},"html":"<p><a href=\"https://atp.fm/episodes/335\">John Siracusa</a>, in episode 335 of <a href=\"https://atp.fm\">ATP</a>:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"transcript\">\n<p>\"We are trying to win on quality\".

This is <em>the most important</em> thing. Noise must be low during the \"networking phase\", which means that the venue should not produce too much sound acoustically (and if it's not possible, simply reduce the number of people attending your event). People should be able to talk to each other at more than 20cm away after a talk. I can't count the number of times I approached a group, finding that I couldn't hear one single word because the room was too loud.</li>\n<li><strong>Get 3 mics</strong> at least. One for the moderator, one for the speaker (or group of speakers), and one for the audience. The audience also wants to listen to the questions. The speaker or moderator should repeat the question after hearing it anyways, but this common practice is often forgotten, unfortunately.</li>\n<li><strong>Fresh air access</strong>. This is more for conferences, since meetups are usually shorter. There's nothing worse than not being able to go outside for a few minutes every hour. Headaches and odors await otherwise.</li>\n<li><strong>Find ways to nudge people to talk to each other</strong>. There will be groups of people that know each other, so the task is, by default, harder for strangers. Give them help, find ways to make interaction more natural. It's not that hard, I think (but it depends on the venue and what your event is about). For conferences, what I like is when other activities are offered (games for examples) — it's good to have breaks. And many times you can meet new people more easily in a different setup.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce</strong>. <strong>The</strong>. <strong>Number</strong>. <strong>Of</strong>. <strong>Attendees</strong>. I get it that organizers don't want a small number of people at their meetups or conferences. It's not as profitable and it's not as good for the press/reputation, but participants will thank you. 1) It helps people talking to each other after a talk. 2) It reduces noise. 3) It creates intimacy and makes people ask more questions to the speakers. 4) And, in fact, it reduces your cost and makes everything more manageable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There're many other things to do, but these are my main frustrations. For the rest, the talk linked above is excellent! :)</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"23b0e901-3eaa-5cb4-beea-316c55254ab3","frontmatter":{"path":null,"title":"Tools","date":"2018-12-05","readableDate":"05 December 2018","redirectFrom":null,"excerpt":null,"excerptQuote":{"name":"Blood, Sweat and Pixels","quote":"That's what tool are.

I looked at other games and saw that it was possible to change its behavior.</p>\n<p>However, it was not really clear how to do that with Unity, so I hope this will help others.</p>\n<h2>Home indicator?</h2>\n<p>Since the iPhone X, the mechanism to go back to the home screen has changed on iOS. You have to swipe from the bottom of the screen, which puts the app back inside its icon.</p>\n<p>By default, at the bottom (where the chin was), the home indicator is <strong>always visible</strong> in an app. It's the black bar you can see on this screenshot:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/home-indicator.jpg\" alt=\"Home indicator default state\"></p>\n<p>For the moment, it's a permanent indicator if the app does not specify a different behavior.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>See what it does in action:</p>\n<figure>\n  <video src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/action.mp4\" width=\"221.5\" height=\"480\" controls muted loop>\n    Your browser doesn't support videos.

With the haptic feedback, it's actually very nice to play with.</p>\n<h2>Changing the behavior in Unity</h2>\n<p>However, this (default) behavior is not great for games. It's too bright and it hides a small portion of the bottom part of the screen. Which can be confusing in games like Steredenn, where many things are displayed at the same time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/steredenn.jpg\" alt=\"Home indicator in Steredenn\"></p>\n<p>Fortunately, Unity (well, technically, it's iOS) provides 2 ways to change the home indicator. Obviously with Unity, the correct one is not the one you would expect.</p>\n<p>You can find these settings by following this procedure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <code class=\"language-text\">Edit → Project Settings → Player</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/unity-01.jpg\" alt=\"Open the Player&#x27;s settings\"></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Then, click on the iOS tab, and find the \"Other Settings\" area.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/unity-02.jpg\" alt=\"Find &#x22;Other Settings&#x22;\"></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Finally, we are interested in 2 settings: \"Hide home button on iPhone X\" and \"Defer system gestures on edges\".</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/unity-03.jpg\" alt=\"&#x22;Hide home button on iPhone X&#x22; and &#x22;Defer system gestures on edges&#x22;\"></p>\n<h2>\"Hide home button on iPhone X\"</h2>\n<p>\"Hide home button on iPhone X\", the one that looks like what we want, is, of course, the <em>wrong one</em>.</p>\n<p>This setting hides the home indicator after a certain inactivity delay. If the user taps on the screen, the home indicator appears again in its full bright glory. In a game, where you will tap all the time, it's the same as showing the indicator permanently.</p>\n<p>Note that this setting can be useful sometimes. For example, if you are doing a video player, or a game that does not require user inputs often, this is what you want. I think there is ways to toggle this behavior when needed.</p>\n<p>This is what YouTube does, for example (it's hard to see cos' the home indicator is black here, but look at the bottom):</p>\n<figure>\n  <video src=\"/images/posts/2018-10-18/hide.mp4\" controls muted loop>\n    Your browser doesn't support videos.

Perfect.</li>\n<li>To go back to the home screen, you have to do the gesture twice. This is also nice, since it prevents accidental gestures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The \"bottom\" checkbox is enough if you only want to change the home indicator behavior.
