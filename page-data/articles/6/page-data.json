As a starting point, I often like to think of the rule of two with things that you have around the house. So, for example, if you have one roll of toilet paper, you really don't have any toilet paper. Because when that one runs out, you're in trouble. So you really need two rolls of toilet paper at all time. It's a redundancy rule, basically. It's where this comes from. […]</p>\n<p>This is one of my little pieces of advice for trying to run a life very smoothly. It's that, everything that you can possibly have two of, you should have it. Two shampoo bottles, two bottles of vitamins, two boxes of cereal, two cartons of eggs. You want duplicates of everything. And then, when you're down to one of those things, that's the sign that you need to buy the next one. In this way, you are never out, you're never out of anything. […]</p>\n<p>It's applicable to everything in your whole life, everything that's important.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><small>(Emphasis mine)</small></p>\n<p>This is so spot on. I try to function like that, but I never put words onto this behavior. Here it is.</p>\n<p>Grey continues:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"transcript\">\n<p>Think this way with computer files: you have only one copy of that file, guess what? You have no copy of this file. I even think it's applicable to work. If you have one source of income, in many ways, it's like you have no source of income. Because if something happens with your main job, you are in lots and lots of trouble. One source of income, no source of income.</p>\n</blockquote>"}},{"node":{"id":"52197db3-5317-5263-b8a2-ba10b98908e8","frontmatter":{"path":null,"title":"Dead or Finished Libraries?","date":"2015-08-21","readableDate":"21 August 2015","redirectFrom":null,"excerpt":null,"excerptQuote":{"name":"Mark Jason Dominus","quote":"People seem to think that all software requires new features or frequent bug fixes.

I would get bug reports, and they would turn out to be bugs in the module's users, not in the module; I would get feature requests, and usually it turned out that what the requester wanted was possible, or even easy, without any changes to the module. Since the module was perfect, there was no need to upload new versions of it to CPAN.</p>\n<p>But then I started to get disturbing emails. \"Hi, I notice you have not updated Text::Template for nine months. Are you still maintaining it?\" \"Hi, I notice you seem to have stopped work on Text::Template. Have you decided to abandon this approach?\" \"Hi, I was thinking of using Text::Template, but I saw it wasn't being maintained any more, so I decided to use Junk::CrappyTemplate, because I need wanted to be sure of getting support for it.\"</p>\n<p>I started wondering if maybe the thing to do was to release a new version of Text::Template every month, with no changes, but with an incremented version number.

Nevertheless, I don't use an ad-blocker either.</p>\n<p>Using the web and using an ad-blocker is hypocrite. Like it or not, it's the most widely used business model on the web.

I don't find ads particularly irritating from now on. Why? Because I find and read honest websites that respect me by not throwing huge walls of ads to my face.

The alternative to ads alongside my content is ads inside my content.</p>\n<p>Let's face it: paywalls don't work. The alternative on the horizon is native advertising. Buzzfeed is now famously refusing to host ads. Instead they sustain themselves by publishing content that subtly supports the agenda of any company with deep enough pockets to pay for it. A viewer's ability to distinguish between native ads and regular articles is small and quickly vanishing. If separate ads stop reaching people, the path to monetization remaining is to change your content to reflect someone else's agenda.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because you cannot distinguish an ad from an article, it's even more insidious and dishonest.

With the explosion of ad tracking technologies and the bloat they add to any webpage, I <em>do use</em> an ad blocker now.

It currently equips the Apple Watch and the new Macbooks.

I didn't use the Watch a lot, but I've also found that it was sometime hard to trigger.</p>\n<p>On the new Macbooks' trackpad, the feeling is fantastic. You can push multiple times and sense the force you apply like it's real.

It's like the menu button of the old Android versions: you tap somewhere (the menu button on Android, firmly with Force Touch) and something may happen. Or not. It's confusing and it's one more hidden gesture with no affordance. It's no better than a long press if its sole purpose is to be another context menu.</p>\n<p>Indeed, on the Apple Watch, Force Touch's goal is to show a secret menu with additional actions. I understand the purpose — the screen is small and you can't fit everything on the screen. But this exact same behavior on a bigger display will have the same problem that Android had with its menu button. It's even worse than a hamburger menu, because the icon won't be there to tell you that an additional layer is present.</p>\n<p>On OS X, I found that the usage of Force Touch is better: it's not a way to show secondary actions, but just a \"deeper version\" of an action.

Spoilers ahead.</strong><br><br></p>\n<p>Well. I didn't <strong>love</strong> the movie (the pace is really <strong>slow</strong>, even for a movie from the sixties, and not being a fan of classical scores might not have helped). I don't mind if a film is ambiguous or doesn't explain much, but 2001 may have gone a bit too far.</p>\n<p>I get that the monoliths are alien artifacts (or an alien race). I get that David Bowman has been translated in a sort of zoo. I vaguely understood that the Star Gate is a kind of allegory about the human reproduction (there's even a foetus and an umbilical cord during this passage — and the Star Child coming back to earth can also be seen as a birth). But why? Why does an extraterrestrial race would want to improve another race? Why use monoliths? Why would they open the gate near Jupiter and not on the moon?</p>\n<p>The HAL sequence was perfectly clear however, even if they don't explain why it was malfunctioning (it doesn't matter). An interpretation talks about the duality between being a perfect computer and having to lie to the crew about the origin of the mission — this would create a paradox inside the machine. I like that idea.</p>\n<p>What, in the end, annoyed me the most were the expections I had. I always thought that the story would be phenomenal. And… it's not, really. It's pretty simple as soon as you think about it (not having explanations don't change that fact — it just wraps the movie in more mysteries). I had the same reaction after finishing Blade Runner, a few years ago.</p>\n<p>It's not the movie's fault: every awesome idea it invented has been reused everywhere since.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie does not feel that dated: the images are still beautiful and the depiction of space is really well-done (especially for its time).</p>\n<p>What I loved about the movie is some of the possible interpretations. I'm really eager to read the novel by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_%28novel%29\">Arthur C. Clarke</a> to dive a bit more into the story. Especially for this theory:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Arthur C. Clarke's theory of the future symbiosis of man and machine, expanded by Kubrick into what Wheat calls \"a spoofy three-evolutionary leaps scenario\": ape to man, an abortive leap from man to machine, and a final, successful leap from man to 'Star Child'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've also found a great quote by Stanley Kubrick about intelligent life when <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_2001:_A_Space_Odyssey\">I was reading articles about the movie</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will say that the God concept is at the heart of 2001 but not any traditional, anthropomorphic image of God.</p>\n<p>I don't believe in any of Earth's monotheistic religions, but I do believe that one can construct an intriguing scientific definition of God, once you accept the fact that there are approximately 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone, that each star is a life-giving sun and that there are approximately 100 billion galaxies in just the visible universe. Given a planet in a stable orbit, not too hot and not too cold, and given a few billion years of chance chemical reactions created by the interaction of a sun's energy on the planet's chemicals, it's fairly certain that life in one form or another will eventually emerge.</p>\n<p>It's reasonable to assume that there must be, in fact, countless billions of such planets where biological life has arisen, and the odds of some proportion of such life developing intelligence are high.</p>\n<p>Now, the sun is by no means an old star, and its planets are mere children in cosmic age, so it seems likely that there are billions of planets in the universe not only where intelligent life is on a lower scale than man but other billions where it is approximately equal and others still where it is hundreds of thousands of millions of years in advance of us.</p>\n<p>When you think of the giant technological strides that man has made in a few millennia—less than a microsecond in the chronology of the universe—can you imagine the evolutionary development that much older life forms have taken? They may have progressed from biological species, which are fragile shells for the mind at best, into immortal machine entities—and then, over innumerable eons, they could emerge from the chrysalis of matter transformed into beings of pure energy and spirit.</p>\n<p>Their potentialities would be limitless and their intelligence ungraspable by humans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>It was one of the greatest shame of my movie culture.
