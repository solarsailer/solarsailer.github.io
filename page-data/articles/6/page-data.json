I didn't have the chance to use this software that much since, but I'm still keeping an eye on it. And I'm really impressed by the 2.0 version.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@bwalkin/introducing-origami-live-and-origami-2-0-a68116294e65\">Brandon Walkin on Medium</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Today, we’re excited to release Origami Live for iOS along with a major new version of Origami for Mac. Origami Live is a new app that lets you use your Origami prototypes on your iPhone or iPad. Alongside it, we’re releasing Origami 2.0, which has a ton of new features, including code exporting, powerful gesture support, Sketch integration, presentation mode, and more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've watched the new video tutorials on the site and tested <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/id942636206\">Origami Live</a> (a companion app that displays your prototype right on your phone). It worked flawlessly and the results were impressive. The app is smooth and perfectly synchronized with the desktop viewer.</p>\n<p>I didn't try the Sketch integration, but if it works as advertised, that's a big win for my workflow.</p>\n<p>They have also added a ton of new shortcuts to speed-up the app. Like if you press <code class=\"language-text\">t</code> between two nodes (when hovering on the output or input of a node), Origami will automatically insert a <code class=\"language-text\">transition</code> node between them:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2015-02-25-origami-shortcut.gif\" alt=\"Origami new shortcuts\"></p>\n<p>There's a lot more that you can learn by <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/origami/tutorials/\">watching the videos</a> or <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/origami/documentation/concepts/KeyboardShortcuts.html\">reading the full list of shortcuts</a>. The documentation is much more complete than when I tried Origami last year. At the time, it was really difficult to get into it. It looks way easier now.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/origami/\">download Origami here</a> (it requires Quartz Composer).</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you are interested in Quartz Composer &#x26; Origami, there's also a plugin named <a href=\"https://labs.ideo.com/2014/05/27/avocado/\">\"Avocado\"</a> that enhances Origami. It has been updated for the 2.0 release, but I didn't use it with the latest version.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>I might be wrong, but I also have the impression that they removed the need for the patch inspector.
