One of them will be the new premium iPhone (5S). The other will be the \"<em>cheap</em>\" one (5C).<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>It will be a big change in the current manufacturing strategy of Apple. Nowadays, there is three iPhones available: the flagship — the iPhone 5 —, and the older and (slightly) cheaper iPhone 4S and 4.</p>\n<p>By releasing the 5C, Apple can get rid of the iPhone 4 and 4S once and for all. It means that there will be only the iPhone 5C, the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 5S. Doing that was probably not possible for Apple before, without compromising the quality of the cheapest model and at the scale at which Apple operates.</p>\n<p>We can infer (if the rumors are true) that Apple has now the production lines to release two new iPhones at the same time.</p>\n<p>This has a big impact: In the fall, all the iPhones sold are going to be capable of using <strong>every</strong> features of the last OS. It's huge. For example, iOS 7 AirDrop only works on one current model: the iPhone 5.<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can put the iPhone way ahead of its competitors that struggle with OSes versions and hardware disparities.</li>\n<li>It will also unify the lineup around the new lightning connector and the 4 inches screen.</li>\n<li>It implies that the hardware and the software are going to evolve at the same pace.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The story is the same with the iPads. I am almost certain that the iPad 2 will disappear this year, leaving only the new Mini and classic iPads available.</p>\n<p>The next year eventual iPhone five inches will fit perfectly in this new strategy: selling only renewed devices with state of the art hardware and software.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: Related, \"<a href=\"http://furbo.org/2013/08/15/its-the-production-line-stupid/\">It’s the Production Line, Stupid</a>\".</p>\n<p><strong>Update 09/12/2013</strong>: Guess I was wrong.

Motion can provide so much information! Maybe the tools to create prototypes are too complicated for most designers?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is something I always speak about: an interface without motion is nothing. There is no context, no link between different objects.</p>\n<p>Windows Phone did a great job to this regard. For example, if you tap a tile on the homescreen, the rest of them move outside the screen before the one you pushed. The system has clearly been created around that, to respond to inputs and act on them.</p>\n<p>Motion is clearly a thing that designers tend to forget. Even if an interface is beautiful, it will look dull if nothing reacts to you. The \"<em>flat</em>\" design movement will exacerbate this. iOS 7 has made depth and context keys citizens of its new UX paradigm.</p>\n<p>Tools to simplify this process are now crucial.</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"3d48eae7-2c35-5f46-b601-48f2cc7816d8","frontmatter":{"path":null,"title":"Marketers","date":"2013-08-13","readableDate":"13 August 2013","redirectFrom":null,"excerpt":null,"excerptQuote":{"name":"Rian Van Der Merwe","quote":"The problem with many Marketers today is that they too often make it all about the company, and not about user needs."}},"fields":{"path":"/2013/08/marketers/","slug":"/2013/08/marketers/"},"html":"<p>“<a href=\"http://www.elezea.com/2013/07/hey-marketers/\">Hey Marketers, making a website is not about you</a>”:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem with many Marketers today is that they too often make it all about the company, and not about user needs.
