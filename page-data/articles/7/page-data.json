For almost everybody, a software or a game at 50-100$ is way too high, and that's fine. What I don't like is that we are now in a situation where  even one buck for an app you use daily is too much. <strong>One buck per app cannot sustain a one-person business.</strong></p>"}},{"node":{"id":"bac63e71-64d3-5cbf-8c19-abd325fb88e4","frontmatter":{"path":null,"title":"Patent Trolls","date":"2013-09-17","readableDate":"17 September 2013","redirectFrom":null,"excerpt":"I'm not against patents and inventors' rights.
