I am merely observing that, in my experience, <strong>coding without planning is just as futile as coding with too much planning</strong>. Software development is <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000071.html\">a wicked problem</a>; you should never make planning decisions without some kind of code prototype to ensure that you're making informed decisions. If you plan too far ahead of the code, I guarantee you are doing work that will be thrown away or altered until it is unrecognizable.</p>\n<p>The most destructive symptom of over-planning is the wrongheaded idea that being a Software Architect™ means drawing a lot of UML diagrams and handing them off to a group of developers in Bangalore. <strong>UML is great if you don't want to do any work; you just draw pictures of what it would look like if work was actually done</strong>. This is not only borderline laziness, it's also a recipe for disaster. You can't architect a real world application on a whiteboard. You must prototype it in code to gather data on the performance and design implications of the choices you are making.</p>\n</blockquote>"}},{"node":{"id":"b0c89b65-1e7c-5746-b270-87c288889fc3","frontmatter":{"path":null,"title":"M7","date":"2013-10-02","readableDate":"02 October 2013","redirectFrom":null,"excerpt":null,"excerptQuote":null},"fields":{"path":"/2013/10/m7/","slug":"/2013/10/m7/"},"html":"<p><a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2013/09/29/more-m7-details-data-storage-battery-life-android-motion-coprocessor-adoption/\">9to5Mac</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For pre-iPhone 5s devices, ARGUS usually drains about 20-30% of battery life per day while running in the background.

For almost everybody, a software or a game at 50-100$ is way too high, and that's fine.

Unless we know what the brand ambition, the brand architecture, and the brand strategy is, we ought to have no opinion. Maybe the logo does exactly what it is supposed to do. Because really, it doesn’t matter whether it looks pretty, or whether someone likes or dislikes the purple or the scallops. The Coca-Cola logo was not designed by a professional designer, it is typographically hideous, but that doesn’t matter. Brand identity is not about visual refinement or aesthetics. It can be purposely ugly, like the London Olympics logo. What is important is that it is done seriously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Personally, I don't care about Yahoo's new logo.
