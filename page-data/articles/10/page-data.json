Just that the OS was built with web technologies. Once again, why should I care ? It's a technical detail, not something that has any value for a consumer.</li>\n<li>Firefox means a slow and heavy browser. The phone costs $69, which will probably result in a crappy hardware. The web (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) is a nice environment, a really powerful one to create websites, but it is <em>slow</em>. I want my phone to run quickly and smoothly. I want it to scroll at 60 fps. This phone (Firefox + crappy hardware + web) sounds <em>not</em> like a good deal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would like to be wrong, but I don't expect much and I don't see the value of Firefox OS, especially against its main competitor — Android.
