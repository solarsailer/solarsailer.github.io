I’d love to rip everything up and start over. But you can only swim against the tide so far, so it’s sometimes satisfying to sift through the garbage and repurpose terrible technologies to make something that is slightly less terrible. […]</p>\n<p>It’s not like a boat with a couple of holes that we can patch; it’s more like trying to sail across an ocean on a pile of accrued garbage. Sure, some of the stuff floats, and it keeps some other stuff from sinking. A better question might be: which parts are good? And you can only answer that if you look at a thing in isolation.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"date":"2015-01-15","readableDate":"15 January 2015","title":"Something Slightly Less Terrible","showPageTitle":null,"excerptLine":null,"excerptQuote":{"name":"Loren Brichter","quote":"The more I learn, the more terrible I think programming is.
