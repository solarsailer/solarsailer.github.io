I am merely observing that, in my experience, <strong>coding without planning is just as futile as coding with too much planning</strong>. Software development is <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000071.html\">a wicked problem</a>; you should never make planning decisions without some kind of code prototype to ensure that you're making informed decisions. If you plan too far ahead of the code, I guarantee you are doing work that will be thrown away or altered until it is unrecognizable.</p>\n<p>The most destructive symptom of over-planning is the wrongheaded idea that being a Software Architect™ means drawing a lot of UML diagrams and handing them off to a group of developers in Bangalore. <strong>UML is great if you don't want to do any work; you just draw pictures of what it would look like if work was actually done</strong>. This is not only borderline laziness, it's also a recipe for disaster. You can't architect a real world application on a whiteboard. You must prototype it in code to gather data on the performance and design implications of the choices you are making.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"date":"2013-10-18","readableDate":"18 October 2013","title":"You Must Prototype It in Code","showPageTitle":null,"excerptLine":null,"excerptQuote":{"name":"Jeff Atwood","quote":"The most destructive symptom of over-planning is the wrongheaded idea that being a Software Architect™ means drawing a lot of UML diagrams and handing them off to a group of developers.
