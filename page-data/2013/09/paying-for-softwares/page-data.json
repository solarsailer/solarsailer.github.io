Ironically, even a lot of developers who work in big companies don't want to pay for softwares.</p>\n<p>The mobile apps markets have made this situation worse.</p>\n<p>I'm currently thinking back about the mobile market, especially for games. At a time, I thought that going mobile-only was the best shot today, but the more I think about it, the more I'm realizing that a platform like Steam (which also drives the prices to the bottom, alas) is more sustainable for a developer/company.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.marco.org/2013/09/28/underscore-price-dynamics\">Marco Arment</a> said in its latest blog post: <em>\"Paid-up-front iOS apps had a great run, but it’s over. Time to make other plans.\"</em>.</p>\n<p>So what does that leave? Freemium? Unfortunately, freemium almost always goes with <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/candy-crush-saga/id553834731?mt=8\">bad apps or games that trick users to pay for more</a>.</p>\n<p>N.B.: To be clear, as a user, I'm happy to <em>pay less</em>. For almost everybody, a software or a game at 50-100$ is way too high, and that's fine. What I don't like is that we are now in a situation where  even one buck for an app you use daily is too much. <strong>One buck per app cannot sustain a one-person business.</strong></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2013-09-30","readableDate":"30 September 2013","title":"Paying for Softwares","showPageTitle":null,"excerptLine":null,"excerptQuote":{"name":"Florian Kugler","quote":"[People] might say otherwise when asked about, but their actions speak pretty clearly: A cup of coffee is worth more than almost every app on the store.
