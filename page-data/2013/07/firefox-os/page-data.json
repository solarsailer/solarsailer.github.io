It will cost $69.</p>\n<p>Mozilla, as usual, promotes the open nature of its OS along with the fact that it is powered by web technologies:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FirefoxOS&amp;src=hash\">#FirefoxOS</a> arrives this month in select markets! Celebrate the 1st smartphone powered completely by Web technologies! <a href=\"http://t.co/Mio0f4zctj\">http://t.co/Mio0f4zctj</a></p>&mdash; Firefox (@firefox) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/firefox/statuses/351641840728023040\">July 1, 2013</a></blockquote>\n<p>I honestly don't get it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As a user, why should I care that my phone is using web technologies? What is the benefit for <strong>me</strong>?</li>\n<li>This is the main argument that I have heard about FirefoxOS. Not that it is fast, features-rich or with a huge ecosystem. Just that the OS was built with web technologies. Once again, why should I care ? It's a technical detail, not something that has any value for a consumer.</li>\n<li>Firefox means a slow and heavy browser. The phone costs $69, which will probably result in a crappy hardware. The web (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) is a nice environment, a really powerful one to create websites, but it is <em>slow</em>. I want my phone to run quickly and smoothly. I want it to scroll at 60 fps. This phone (Firefox + crappy hardware + web) sounds <em>not</em> like a good deal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would like to be wrong, but I don't expect much and I don't see the value of Firefox OS, especially against its main competitor — Android. There are Android phones that are cheaper AND with Google Play.</p>\n<p>I agree with <a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/\">Benedict Evans</a>:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>When I hear people say how great Firefox OS is, they talk about operators, OEMs, litigation... and sometimes remember to mention users</p>&mdash; Benedict Evans (@BenedictEvans) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/statuses/351646258856857600\">July 1, 2013</a></blockquote>\n<p>And:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Everyone agrees that the web is the future and apps are a dead end.
