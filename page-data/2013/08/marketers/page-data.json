I’m sorry, but it’s not about changing people, and it’s not about making them do stuff. That’s old school thinking from a time when brands could steamroll their way into the consciousness and wallets of people through clever advertising and sleight of hand. Those days are over. Now our job is not to make it about how awesome we are, <mark>but how well we help people accomplish their goals</mark>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Further readings related to this subject:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.90percentofeverything.com/2013/07/23/the-slippery-slope/\">The Slippery Slope</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://seriouspony.com/blog/2013/7/24/your-app-makes-me-fat\">Your App Makes Me Fat</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"2013-08-13","readableDate":"13 August 2013","title":"Marketers","showPageTitle":null,"excerptLine":null,"excerptQuote":{"name":"Rian Van Der Merwe","quote":"The problem with many Marketers today is that they too often make it all about the company, and not about user needs."}},"fields":{"path":"/2013/08/marketers/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"e49d65fb-c995-5432-8058-1b20251423a7"}}}
