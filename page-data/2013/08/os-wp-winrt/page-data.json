The experience was pretty good, except for the lack of apps.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>I created some Windows Phone 7 applications (notably <a href=\"https://dmayance.com/culturez-vous/\">Culturez-Vous</a> with Damien Mayance). I also developed a WinRT library for my daily work then — before Pixelnest.</p>\n<p>I had a Windows 8 and a WinRT device (Surface) at my workplace these days, and it was horrible. The experience was bad — the OS was a schizophrenic beast, always switching between the classic desktop and the Metro environment, with no apps. It was slow, unrefined, confusing. <a href=\"http://cl.ly/image/102N3O3C0k3z1c0g0u3g\">The font rendering was horrid</a>.</p>\n<p>When the announcement of WinRT became public, I wondered why Microsoft did not leverage its Windows Phone OS, instead of starting from scratch with Windows 8. A tablet with Windows Phone would have been far better than a tablet with the fail that is WinRT/Windows 8.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>To be fair, however, even then I thought that iOS was a superior OS. But I like to try a new OS to discover what works and not, and to make my own opinion.<br><br>Windows Phone lacked some polish but was rock solid, especially when compared to Android. At least, the Lumia was a supercharged feature phone with a browser and a decent keyboard.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"date":"2013-08-05","readableDate":"05 August 2013","title":"Windows Phone and WinRT","showPageTitle":null,"excerptLine":null,"excerptQuote":{"name":"Paul Thurrott","quote":"Microsoft already has a mobile platform with a thriving ecosystem.
