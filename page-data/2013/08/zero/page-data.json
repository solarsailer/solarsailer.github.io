The trick is finding out how you work best. For me, I tend to take an OCD approach to emptying things. I keep a clean desktop: under three icons at a time, preferably. It made sense to use my desktop as a kind of bucket I needed to empty: it's always there, and I can put short, actionable items there because that visually disturbs me enough to want to clean it off (and do the action).</p>\n<p>This is why Inbox Zero works so well for handling email for me. I try to use that mentality everywhere, really: iOS notifications, browser tabs, terminal tabs, and so on. Reducing ambiguity around what to do next is a huge deal for me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have a similar mindset. I hate having stuffs in front of me:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I close any app I don't use now</li>\n<li>I keep my tabs at a minimum</li>\n<li>I empty my mail inbox as much as I can</li>\n<li>I prune my RSS and Twitter feeds</li>\n<li>I clean my OS desktop</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A sort of minimalism? Probably.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2013-08-09","readableDate":"09 August 2013","title":"Zero","showPageTitle":null,"excerptLine":null,"excerptQuote":{"name":"Zach Holman","quote":"The trick is finding out how you work best.
