One of them will be the new premium iPhone (5S). The other will be the \"<em>cheap</em>\" one (5C).<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>It will be a big change in the current manufacturing strategy of Apple. Nowadays, there is three iPhones available: the flagship — the iPhone 5 —, and the older and (slightly) cheaper iPhone 4S and 4.</p>\n<p>By releasing the 5C, Apple can get rid of the iPhone 4 and 4S once and for all. It means that there will be only the iPhone 5C, the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 5S. Doing that was probably not possible for Apple before, without compromising the quality of the cheapest model and at the scale at which Apple operates.</p>\n<p>We can infer (if the rumors are true) that Apple has now the production lines to release two new iPhones at the same time.</p>\n<p>This has a big impact: In the fall, all the iPhones sold are going to be capable of using <strong>every</strong> features of the last OS. It's huge. For example, iOS 7 AirDrop only works on one current model: the iPhone 5.<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can put the iPhone way ahead of its competitors that struggle with OSes versions and hardware disparities.</li>\n<li>It will also unify the lineup around the new lightning connector and the 4 inches screen.</li>\n<li>It implies that the hardware and the software are going to evolve at the same pace.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The story is the same with the iPads. I am almost certain that the iPad 2 will disappear this year, leaving only the new Mini and classic iPads available.</p>\n<p>The next year eventual iPhone five inches will fit perfectly in this new strategy: selling only renewed devices with state of the art hardware and software.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: Related, \"<a href=\"http://furbo.org/2013/08/15/its-the-production-line-stupid/\">It’s the Production Line, Stupid</a>\".</p>\n<p><strong>Update 09/12/2013</strong>: Guess I was wrong. The new lineup is made of an iPhone 5C, 5S and the old 4S.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>Cheap <strong>does not necessarily mean low quality</strong>.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>I take AirDrop as an example because I think that this technology is going to be a decisive advantage for Apple. The fact that it is currently not available on every model is a pain. Hopefully, the new lineup will mitigate the problem a lot.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"date":"2013-08-16","readableDate":"16 August 2013","title":"The Lineup of 5","showPageTitle":null,"excerptLine":null,"excerptQuote":null},"fields":{"path":"/2013/08/the-lineup-of-5/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"762d1be2-768c-518e-a872-974b70af7764"}}}
