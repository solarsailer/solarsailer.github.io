People dislike change because change is work. They have to figure out what changed, adapt to it, relearn the UI, and still try to get their job done (they one they used to know how to do). <strong>So the next time you hear “People hate change” think to yourself “People don’t hate change. They hate the work of change”.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(emphasis mine)</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2013-08-28","readableDate":"28 August 2013","title":"Amazon's new product page","showPageTitle":null,"excerptLine":null,"excerptQuote":{"name":"Joshua Porter","quote":"So the next time you hear “People hate change” think to yourself “People don’t hate change.
