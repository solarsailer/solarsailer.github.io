It's all in your brain, so you don't have to explain anything, write anything down, have meetings, draw on whiteboards, etc. Your available time to work collapses down to solving specific business problems with every line of code or web page update. Imagine a case where you never have to compromise, argue, make brain dead concessions or spend resources on proving your position. Assuming you are right, and have a good head for business, marketing and writing half-way decent code, you can solve a small problem very efficiently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hard but hyper-efficient.</p>\n<p>We work <em>a bit</em> like that at <a href=\"https://pixelnest.io\">Pixelnest</a>. <a href=\"https://dmayance.com\">Damien</a> and me have a slightly different skill set, thus we can split the work almost equally. The advantage is that we can discuss together to avoid finishing in a dead end.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2013-08-19","readableDate":"19 August 2013","title":"Team of One","showPageTitle":null,"excerptLine":null,"excerptQuote":{"name":"Snoonan","quote":"When you're a team of one, your I/O bandwidth is almost infinite.
