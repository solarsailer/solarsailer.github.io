It currently equips the Apple Watch and the new Macbooks. You press firmly on the screen and the haptic engine will register a \"deep\" press.</p>\n<p>On the Watch, I found that the feedback was not properly mapped to the press (it's a tap on your wrist, not on your finger). I didn't use the Watch a lot, but I've also found that it was sometime hard to trigger.</p>\n<p>On the new Macbooks' trackpad, the feeling is fantastic. You can push multiple times and sense the force you apply like it's real. You may not even understand that it's not a true physical button.</p>\n<p>But… <strong>Force Touch is not discoverable.</strong></p>\n<p>There is no visual clue that Force Touch is available — either on the screen or on a specific control. It's like the menu button of the old Android versions: you tap somewhere (the menu button on Android, firmly with Force Touch) and something may happen. Or not. It's confusing and it's one more hidden gesture with no affordance. It's no better than a long press if its sole purpose is to be another context menu.</p>\n<p>Indeed, on the Apple Watch, Force Touch's goal is to show a secret menu with additional actions. I understand the purpose — the screen is small and you can't fit everything on the screen. But this exact same behavior on a bigger display will have the same problem that Android had with its menu button. It's even worse than a hamburger menu, because the icon won't be there to tell you that an additional layer is present.</p>\n<p>On OS X, I found that the usage of Force Touch is better: it's not a way to show secondary actions, but just a \"deeper version\" of an action. In QuickTime, for example, you press firmly on the forward button and the video will fast forward faster for each level you reach. It's still hard to know when it's available and might result in nothing, but at least, it's consistant with its source.</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"2fcd4305-d7b1-544b-bfba-365d96d3a0b9","frontmatter":{"path":null,"title":"Space Odyssey","date":"2015-04-26","readableDate":"26 April 2015","redirectFrom":null,"excerpt":"I've finally convinced myself to watch “2001: A Space Odyssey”.

Spoilers ahead.</strong><br><br></p>\n<p>Well. I didn't <strong>love</strong> the movie (the pace is really <strong>slow</strong>, even for a movie from the sixties, and not being a fan of classical scores might not have helped). I don't mind if a film is ambiguous or doesn't explain much, but 2001 may have gone a bit too far.</p>\n<p>I get that the monoliths are alien artifacts (or an alien race). I get that David Bowman has been translated in a sort of zoo. I vaguely understood that the Star Gate is a kind of allegory about the human reproduction (there's even a foetus and an umbilical cord during this passage — and the Star Child coming back to earth can also be seen as a birth). But why? Why does an extraterrestrial race would want to improve another race? Why use monoliths? Why would they open the gate near Jupiter and not on the moon?</p>\n<p>The HAL sequence was perfectly clear however, even if they don't explain why it was malfunctioning (it doesn't matter). An interpretation talks about the duality between being a perfect computer and having to lie to the crew about the origin of the mission — this would create a paradox inside the machine. I like that idea.</p>\n<p>What, in the end, annoyed me the most were the expections I had. I always thought that the story would be phenomenal. And… it's not, really. It's pretty simple as soon as you think about it (not having explanations don't change that fact — it just wraps the movie in more mysteries). I had the same reaction after finishing Blade Runner, a few years ago.</p>\n<p>It's not the movie's fault: every awesome idea it invented has been reused everywhere since.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie does not feel that dated: the images are still beautiful and the depiction of space is really well-done (especially for its time).</p>\n<p>What I loved about the movie is some of the possible interpretations. I'm really eager to read the novel by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_%28novel%29\">Arthur C. Clarke</a> to dive a bit more into the story. Especially for this theory:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Arthur C. Clarke's theory of the future symbiosis of man and machine, expanded by Kubrick into what Wheat calls \"a spoofy three-evolutionary leaps scenario\": ape to man, an abortive leap from man to machine, and a final, successful leap from man to 'Star Child'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've also found a great quote by Stanley Kubrick about intelligent life when <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_2001:_A_Space_Odyssey\">I was reading articles about the movie</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will say that the God concept is at the heart of 2001 but not any traditional, anthropomorphic image of God.</p>\n<p>I don't believe in any of Earth's monotheistic religions, but I do believe that one can construct an intriguing scientific definition of God, once you accept the fact that there are approximately 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone, that each star is a life-giving sun and that there are approximately 100 billion galaxies in just the visible universe. Given a planet in a stable orbit, not too hot and not too cold, and given a few billion years of chance chemical reactions created by the interaction of a sun's energy on the planet's chemicals, it's fairly certain that life in one form or another will eventually emerge.</p>\n<p>It's reasonable to assume that there must be, in fact, countless billions of such planets where biological life has arisen, and the odds of some proportion of such life developing intelligence are high.</p>\n<p>Now, the sun is by no means an old star, and its planets are mere children in cosmic age, so it seems likely that there are billions of planets in the universe not only where intelligent life is on a lower scale than man but other billions where it is approximately equal and others still where it is hundreds of thousands of millions of years in advance of us.</p>\n<p>When you think of the giant technological strides that man has made in a few millennia—less than a microsecond in the chronology of the universe—can you imagine the evolutionary development that much older life forms have taken? They may have progressed from biological species, which are fragile shells for the mind at best, into immortal machine entities—and then, over innumerable eons, they could emerge from the chrysalis of matter transformed into beings of pure energy and spirit.</p>\n<p>Their potentialities would be limitless and their intelligence ungraspable by humans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>It was one of the greatest shame of my movie culture.

It's in our nature: human doesn't like change (and new things) until it reaches a certain threshold and becomes acceptable. And to be fair, it might just be a fad.</p>\n<p>The iPhone (and other touch-based smartphones) were also considered as useless gadgets in their beginnings too — almost everybody has a smartphone now, right?<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>But like the iPhone, there's a chance the Apple Watch will succeed and become a thing (that's a big if, but I'm still more inclined to believe it will than not).</p>\n<p><strong>For the moment, I don't think there're many usages that make a watch (or other wearable devices) truly better than a phone</strong>. Hopefully, we are only at the beginning. To understand what we can do as developers, we have to use those objects daily.</p>\n<p>That's not to say they are completely useless as of today.</p>\n<p>The usages that intrigue me the most are:<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maps navigation (\"quick glance, straight on, a few haptic taps, go right — bam — you're arrived!\").</li>\n<li>Services like Capitaine Train <a href=\"https://blog.capitainetrain.com/8788-apple-watch\">(with an awesome watch app design that clearly understands its support and context)</a>.</li>\n<li>Passbooks and Apple Pay (if it ever comes to France).</li>\n<li>Music and podcasts playback (with Overcast or a remote).</li>\n<li>Fitness and health.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>But not notifications.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>I'm a huge proponent of disabling almost all notifications.</p>\n<p>I restrict the apps that can send notifications to the bare minimum (SMS, calendar, reminders and that's most of it) because I think that notifications are a nuisance.</p>\n<p>You don't need to know when someone followed you on Instagram or Twitter. You don't need to be interrupted when you receive a mail. That's also why I'm even more aggresive against sound for notifications (I do receive my mail every hour, but <em>silently</em>). I'd rather grab my phone and act willingly on something than being always distracted.</p>\n<p>People who are flooded by notifications (like <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/a/apple-watch-review\">tech reviewers</a>) and criticize a device because of that ARE the issue, not the device. A wearable will only make their problem worse, because they will also allow access to those nuisance to a device that is physically connected to their body. And which can tap them <strong>anytime</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>What is really making sense is to have quick pertinent contextual information available at a glance.</p>\n<p>Like, when your train is ready to leave — which platform, what seat? That's useful: you are in a urge, you walk quickly and taking your phone out of your pocket takes time and precision.</p>\n<p>Having your itinerary directions given <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/04/23/apple-watch-user-guide\">to you by a few vibrations</a>?
