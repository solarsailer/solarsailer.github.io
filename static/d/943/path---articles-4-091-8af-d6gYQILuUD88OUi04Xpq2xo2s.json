[…]</p>\n<p>Using large teams of people specially trained to watch movies, Netflix deconstructed Hollywood. They paid people to watch films and tag them with all kinds of metadata. This process is so sophisticated and precise that taggers receive a 36-page training document that teaches them how to rate movies on their sexually suggestive content, goriness, romance levels, and even narrative elements like plot conclusiveness. […]</p>\n<p>The Netflix Quantum Theory doc spelled out ways of tagging movie endings, the \"social acceptability\" of lead characters, and dozens of other facets of a movie. Many values are \"scalar,\" that is to say, they go from 1 to 5. So, every movie gets a romance rating, not just the ones labeled \"romantic\" in the personalized genres. Every movie's ending is rated from happy to sad, passing through ambiguous. Every plot is tagged. Lead characters' jobs are tagged. Movie locations are tagged. Everything. Everyone.</p>\n<p>That's the data at the base of the pyramid. It is the basis for creating all the altgenres that I scraped. Netflix's engineers took the microtags and created a syntax for the genres, much of which we were able to reproduce in our generator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This article completely blew my mind. Great journalism.</p>\n<p>The idea to tag any movie that much and create ultra-specific subgenres is so clever. Hell of a work too.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Concerning the <em>Perry Mason</em> mystery, I found an interesting <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/#comment-1184453715\">explanation</a> in the comments (yep):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Actually, Alexis, I am baffled by your conclusion that the Perry Mason Mystery is a \"ghost in the machine\".</p>\n<p>To me it seems obvious: there is a subgenre, \"Understated Cerebral Mysteries with Ironclad Plots, Good Dialogue, Not Much Action or Romance, and on the Side of the Defense\", that is popular with viewers yet <em>drastically</em> underpopulated. It's so drastically underpopulated that the show that's a best-fit for the category is <em>enormously</em> popular, much more popular than anyone realized.</p>\n<p>Far from being a \"bug\", this is programming <em>platinum</em> for Netflix. If they're as smart as I think they are, this is the subgenre where they should be looking to make a TV series. The biggest problem will be finding a showrunner and scriptwriters who are able to go against so many of Hollywood's cliches and assumptions. They need to make something where what is visually interesting, striking, or exciting is unimportant, but where there are no holes in the plots. Very high degree of difficulty, and only profitable to Netflix, which makes money from its shows, not from the advertising.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sounds a bit like <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1475582/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\">Sherlock</a>, no?</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"12bc75ca-599b-5b14-8cf6-b230d33c09c2","frontmatter":{"path":null,"title":"Pixelnest — Unity 2D tutorial","date":"2013-11-21","readableDate":"21 November 2013","redirectFrom":null,"excerpt":"We cooked a complete tutorial about Unity and its new 2D tools.

Though it fits well with the content, I find it a bit overdramatic. The end is also a tad lengthy, which is unfortunate.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, I liked what I heard. <em>Which makes me consider…</em></p>\n<p>Regularly, I find myself stuck with incredibly ill-conceived things that frustrate me. These objects, rules or designs are things as simple as an ATM, a software or a door. They make us loose time, or worse, do (severe) mistakes.</p>\n<p>For example: there is a crossroad near my parents house. A few years ago, the mayor decided to remove the road signs at this place AND to not replace it. In France, there is an implicit rule which states that when there are no signs, you have to let the cars at your right cross the junction first. This rule is stupid. <strong>When you drive, you have no time to doubt</strong>. A sign serves primarily as way to convey a danger or a rule, without making you think. You know what you have to do instantly. <em>If you see a stop sign, you stop</em>. That is all.</p>\n<p>This implicit rule makes us do the contrary. At a junction like the one I talked about before, you see nothing, so you have to think, analyze and react. It's easy to have a (minor) car accident there. Moreover, people of my town had used this junction for years, knowing precisely how to react. But now, the priority rule has changed, and it's a mess. The result? In the best case, everybody stop, wait for 10 seconds to analyze the place and then drive.</p>\n<p><strong>This is a result of a design decision. Someone decided to do that.</strong> In this case, someone decided to break something that worked well for all this time.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, it might just be a dumb design that put you in an embarrassing situation. If you are a man, just remember the last time you have used a flat and too-high urinal. :)</p>\n<p>When I talk about that with some of my friends, they think that I'm excessively demanding and that the problem is me. Perhaps.</p>\n<p>I will conclude with a quote from the talk:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are professions more harmful than (industrial) design, <strong>but only a very few of them.</strong></p>\n<p>— Victor Papanek <em>(modified by Mike Monteiro)</em></p>\n</blockquote>"}}],"pathPrefix":"articles","first":false,"last":false,"index":4,"pageCount":10,"additionalContext":{}}}
