As soon as you tap the button, the photo is uploaded and you have to delete it to fix your error.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can use the last few photos too. Which might represent 80% of the last remaining use cases.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It\'s so simple and clever that once you have seen it, you can only think: <em>"Of course."</em>.</p>',frontmatter:{date:"2014-06-03",readableDate:"03 June 2014",title:"Design detail in iOS 8 Messages",showPageTitle:null,excerptLine:"One of the features that I wanted the most in iOS 8 was simple: Add a “Use Last Photo Taken” button in the Messages app.",excerptQuote:null},fields:{path:"/2014/06/design-detail-ios8-messages/"}}},pathContext:{id:"/Users/ashen/Code/solarsailer.net/content/posts/2014-06-03-design-detail-ios8-messages.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
