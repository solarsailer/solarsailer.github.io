The blog is relegated to a secondary part of the website. I still plan to publish articles, but the focus of Solar Sailer is to quickly know who I am, what I've done and where you can find me.</p>\\n<p>The rest is a bonus. However, I'm still planning to expand this website in new ways — adding a portfolio and a resume, most notably.</p>\\n<p>If you want to read more about why it took so long, continue. Otherwise, you know everything. 😉</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>I was using <a href=\\\"http://jekyllrb.com\\\">Jekyll</a> to generate this blog and hosting it with <a href=\\\"https://pages.github.com\\\">GitHub Pages</a> (Jekyll is maintained by GitHub, so the workflow to publish a Jekyll site on GitHub is dead simple if you accept their dependencies and constraints). Then, one day, GitHub said that they were deprecating the Markdown engine that I was using, affecting a few posts I wrote.</p>\\n<p>I wanted to redesign this site for a long time, so instead of just updating the posts, I decided to rewrite the whole blog (like every developer do each time they have a small change to do — it's our curse).</p>\\n<p>I experimented. I designed 6 or 8 layouts. I was never happy, and I never gave me the time to finish it properly. When I started to implement a new design, I let it wither for a few months. And when I came back, I just ditched it all. Again. And again. And again.</p>\\n<p>I moved the blog to <a href=\\\"https://gohugo.io\\\">Hugo</a>. Then I came back to Jekyll once more. I modernized everything. Then I was fed up with Jekyll again, so I tried <a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\\\">Gatsby</a>. And I did other things, abandoning the redesign once again. Meanwhile, and even if I had dozens of drafts, I couldn't update the old blog with new articles. So it languished there, in its infamous uglyness (something I was not proud of, calling myself a <em>designer</em>).</p>\\n<p>And finally, I retried Gatsby recently and completed a new design. It's not perfect. It's not well tested on older browsers. But it works, in a good enough way for me — I have already spent too much time on it.</p>\\n<p>It's time to ship.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>More than just a simple redesign, I wanted to reboot the site to add a <strong>portfolio</strong>, a <strong>resume</strong>, a <strong>documentation·codex·tutorials</strong>, as well as a <strong>photo</strong> and <strong>automation</strong> sections. Of course, if I wanted to do it all, I would never have finished anything, so I just focused on a simple redesign at the time being, keeping in mind that the site would be expanded later.</p>\\n<p>The goal, in the end, is to do all that, if I'm motivated enough. A good start would be to publish new articles with a regular schedule.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>Another thing that was ticking for this website was the \\\"deprecation\\\" of HTTP by Chrome in an upcoming update. By deprecation, I mean that Chrome will show an \\\"Unsecure\\\" flag on non-HTTPS websites. HTTP will always work, but it will be relegated to a legacy protocol that nobody should continue to use.</p>\\n<p>I was in a hurry to complete this reboot before this update. I soft-launched the new site a few weeks ago, and tweaked it since. And now it's official.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>To be a little bit exhaustive:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>I have 6 designs in Sketch files, plus a few more that I did directly in the browser.</li>\\n<li>I did more than 50 logos. And I'm still not satisfied by the one I use now (it's not the best that I did, but I think it fits better with the layout and what I wanted to do). It's so hard to capture the essence of something personal. It's a blank canvas without any constraints.</li>\\n<li>I tried 4 or 5 blog engines (<a href=\\\"http://jekyllrb.com\\\">Jekyll</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.metalsmith.io\\\">Metalsmith</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\\\">Gatsby</a>, <a href=\\\"https://gohugo.io\\\">Hugo</a> and others). I even toyed with the idea of creating my own.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I'm so exhausted by this whole process and that's mainly why I'm so long to end this blog post. 😇</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>I hope you'll like it.</p>\"}},{\"node\":{\"id\":\"/Users/ashen/Code/solarsailer.net/content/posts/2016-04-01-dwarf-fortress-systems.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":null,\"title\":\"Cats, taverns and cleaning systems\",\"date\":\"2016-04-01\",\"readableDate\":\"01 April 2016\",\"redirectFrom\":null,\"excerpt\":null,\"excerptQuote\":{\"name\":\"Tarn Adams\",\"quote\":\"It’s funny how I have popular bugs, right?

You shouldn’t have popular bugs. […] I added taverns to fortress mode, so the dwarves will go to a proper establishment, get mugs, and make orders, and they’ll drink in the mug. And, you know, things happen, mugs get spilled, there’s some alcohol on the ground.</p>\\n<p>Now, the cats would walk into the taverns, right, and because of the old blood footprint code from, like, eight years ago or something, they would get alcohol on their feet. It was originally so people could pad blood around, but now any liquid, right, so they get alcohol on their feet. And then I wanted to add cleaning stuff so when people were bathing, or I even made eyelids work for no reason, because I do random things sometimes. So cats will lick and clean themselves, and on a lark, when I made them clean themselves I’m like, ‘Well, it’s a cat. When you do lick cleaning, you actually ingest the thing that you’re cleaning off, right? They make hairballs, so they must swallow something, right?' And so the cats, when they cleaned the alcohol off their feet, they all got drunk. Because they were drinking.</p>\\n<p>But the numbers were off on that. I had never thought about, you know, activating inebriation syndromes back when I was adding the cleaning stuff. I was just like, ‘Well, they ingest it and they get a full dose,’ but a full dose is a whole mug of alcohol for a cat-sized creature, and it does all the blood alcohol size-based calculations, so the cats would get sick and vomit all over the tavern.</p>\\n<p>The original bug report is, ‘There’s cat vomit all over my tavern, and there’s a few dead cats,’ or whatever, and they’re like, ‘Why? This is broken.’</p>\\n<p>People helped me with this. We were all looking and figuring out, ‘What the heck is going on here?’, and that was the chain of events. It’s like doing the detective work to figure out that entire chain of events is what happened. You can see how adding just a tavern that gave the opportunity for spilling alcohol, which was really uncommon before, now all the spilled alcohol starts to, form in one location where something could start to happen. You activate bugs and little parts of code from eight, six years ago where you just didn’t balance the numbers because it didn’t matter. […]</p>\\n<p><strong>PC Gamer: So the cats’ inebriation system was just based on any organism would have the potential to get drunk.</strong></p>\\n<p>Yeah, right now it’s any creature that has blood, and that includes, like, an octopus. I don’t know if an octopus can get drunk or not.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The way the different systems are all interacting together is so fascinating. Especially when the outcome becomes something like this. :)</p>\\n<hr>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I don’t even use version control. If you don’t know what that is then you’re not gonna yell at me. If you even know what version control is you’re gonna be like, ‘You don’t use version control? You don’t use source control? What is wrong with you? How can you even work?’</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>I'm still baffled to know that many game developers (or other developers) work without version control. It seems so dangerous, but… well.</p>\"}},{\"node\":{\"id\":\"/Users/ashen/Code/solarsailer.net/content/posts/2016-03-19-delight.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":null,\"title\":\"Delight\",\"date\":\"2016-03-19\",\"readableDate\":\"19 March 2016\",\"redirectFrom\":null,\"excerpt\":null,\"excerptQuote\":{\"name\":\"Craig Mod\",\"quote\":\"And what is delight?

Church</a>:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>First, let's cover the technical issues. It's verbose, combines the worst of both worlds between static and dynamic typing by having a hobbled but extremely clunky type system, and mandates running on a virtual machine (VM) that has a macroscopic startup time (not an issue for long-running servers, but painful for command-line applications). […]</p>\\n<p>The VM itself has a lot to recommend it. It offers concurrency and garbage collection at a level of quality that, until recently, wasn't found anywhere else. […] Much important software in the early 2000s was written in Java because, at the time, it was the best choice, even taking the mediocrity of the language itself into account. It had Unicode (albeit, UTF-16) from the start and a strong concurrency story, and it was a notch above C++ in terms of user experience. […]</p>\\n<p>If you put Java on a technical trial, it doesn't do so bad. The <em>language</em> sucks, the platform is pretty good for most purposes. I do hate the dominant interpretation of \\\"object-oriented programming\\\" with a passion, because it objectively sucks. […]</p>\\n<p>So let's talk about the political and cultural issues. First, the dominant Java culture is one of mediocrity and bad taste, with MetaModelVibratorVisitorFactory classes dominating. I've heard a number of experts on \\\"the Java issue\\\" argue that Java's biggest problem is the community, and that comes directly from the fact that good programmers don't want to deal with the bastardization of OOP that has entrenched itself in mainstream corporate development. You have a lot of people who trained up as \\\"Java programmers\\\", haven't seen a command line ever, and have no clue how the computer actually works. Most of them have never actually written a program; they just write classes and some Senior Chief Architect (who makes $246,001 per year and hasn't written a line of code since the 1990s) figures out how to stitch them together, and then tells some other clueless junior how to implement the glue in the gutshot hope that one will actually have the talent to make an actual working program out of the mess.</p>\\n<p>This isn't inherent to the JVM, because Clojure (currently hosted on the JVM, although its endgame seems to be language-agnosticism) has a radically different (and better) community. Scala's community is more mixed, but the top Scala engineers (the ones making tools like Spark and Kestrel) are really fucking good.</p>\\n<p>[…]</p>\\n<p>So, the short answer is: it's mostly not about the underlying platform (which is generally of high quality) and its only partly about the language (which is mediocre but can't be blamed directly for community problems). It goes a lot deeper than that, and not all of it is Java's fault. However, Java takes its share of the blame for its clear favoritism toward large programs (technically, established by its long startup time) and by its support of a very ugly (and counterproductive) variety of object-oriented programming.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.quora.com/Why-do-many-software-engineers-not-like-Java/answer/Stanley-Idesis\\\">Stanley Idesis</a>:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I’ve read the popular answers and will claim no contest to a majority of the complaints I found. […] However, here’s why I <em>love</em> it. […]</p>\\n<p>In the Android world, developers use Java because they <em>have</em> to. However, much creativity has sprung from that limitation. People have written many excellent OS libraries in Java for Android. The platform continues to be a hotbed of Java activity which developers contribute to from all over the world. […]</p>\\n<p>Android’s open nature, wide distribution, and powerful support from Google are almost enough to make Java hip again. […] Sure, some may argue that other runtimes and languages can enable the same capabilities of the device, but for whatever reason, Android chose Java.</p>\\n<p>Until Google changes its mind, Java will remain relevant and the source of fascinating developments in the software community as long as Android remains popular.</p>\\n</blockquote>\"}},{\"node\":{\"id\":\"/Users/ashen/Code/solarsailer.net/content/posts/2016-03-17-virtual-reality.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":null,\"title\":\"VR is not the future\",\"date\":\"2016-03-17\",\"readableDate\":\"17 March 2016\",\"redirectFrom\":null,\"excerpt\":\"Right now, journalists and tech companies are all buzzing and craving for VR.

It's in books, in movies, in games. In our collective mind, virtual reality is like flying cars: it's a dream that we always envisioned for our future as an high tech society.</p>\\n<p>Well, we all remember that we didn't get flying cars for the new millenium.</p>\\n<p>Incredible technologies portrayed in science-fiction books or movies are generally not really that relevant in reality. Or they are so hard to build that we can't even fathom to create them now. In our history, the way our society evolved was often very different to how we imagined it in our fictions. When you confront with the reality, many dreams are just what they are: dreams. I would need to dig up some sociology courses that I had—but I remember that this is a recurrent theme in our evolution.</p>\\n<p>For VR, it's a bit different: we (almost) have the technology. However, I do think that it's just a fad. A fad that excites many marketers or entrepreneurs. <em>Real-world applications are so narrow.</em></p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>VR is a cool demo. VR is impressive.

Yes, the immersion is better. Nop, the controls are worse. You can't move in a game without hitting a wall. You can't use your hands without complex gloves or other utensils. The possibility are not that huge: okay, it might be great for some first-person games where you don't move. But that's just a small subset of all the games we can create.</p>\\n<p>VR is ugly.

However, it's the lexer's role to add them, not the developer. <a href=\\\"http://zachholman.com/posts/shit-work/\\\">Let the machines do the shit work.</a></p>\\n<p>Here's the extract from <a href=\\\"https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#semicolons\\\">Effective Go</a>:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Like C, Go's formal grammar uses semicolons to terminate statements, but unlike in C, those semicolons do not appear in the source. Instead the lexer uses a simple rule to insert semicolons automatically as it scans, so the input text is mostly free of them.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>And unlike in an extremely <a href=\\\"http://blog.izs.me/post/2353458699/an-open-letter-to-javascript-leaders-regarding\\\">popular</a> <a href=\\\"http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2010/05/semicolons/\\\">language</a>, Go imposes some formatting rules to its programmers and nobody has a problem with <a href=\\\"http://inimino.org/~inimino/blog/javascript_semicolons\\\">ASI</a>.</p>\\n<p>However, there's still one perfectly valid case where semicolons are not optional:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\" data-language=\\\"go\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-go\\\"><code class=\\\"language-go\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">if</span> v <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">:=</span> math<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">Pow</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>x<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span> v <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span> limit <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\t<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> v\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Between <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">math.Pow(x, n)</code> and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">v &lt; limit</code>, you will find a semicolon. Because the two statements are on the same line, the compiler needs a semicolon to know where to end a statement and start the next one.</p>\\n<p>Basically, the rule is simple:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Do not use a semicolon when a statement ends with a newline.</li>\\n<li>Use a semicolon when a statement is followed by another statement on the same line.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>That's the basic consensus in new languages.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>So, here's my question: <strong>why don't we do the same thing with commas?!</strong></p>\\n<p>Let's look at the following snippet of Swift:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\" data-language=\\\"swift\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-swift\\\"><code class=\\\"language-swift\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> test <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"a\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"b\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"c\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>As you can see, each value of the array is separated by a comma. Same rule as the semicolons: if you are on the same line, use a separator. <em>In this case, it's a comma instead of the semicolon because the semantic is different.</em> Fine.</p>\\n<p>Now, let's look at the same snippet with a multi-lines notation — this example might seem contrived, but this kind of notation is clearer when the values are more complex and/or numerous:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\" data-language=\\\"swift\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-swift\\\"><code class=\\\"language-swift\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> example <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"a\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"b\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"c\\\"</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Wait. What. <strong>It's exactly like in the one-line declaration just above.</strong> Which is not surprising, because almost any language will do that.</p>\\n<p>That's inconsistent though. For semicolons, we omit them when there's a newline, but here, for a comma, we do not.</p>\\n<p>The correct syntax should be:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\" data-language=\\\"swift\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-swift\\\"><code class=\\\"language-swift\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> test <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"a\\\"</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"b\\\"</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"c\\\"</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Simpler, prettier. And it gives a few bonuses beyond the cosmetic aspect:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>It's less error-prone.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>It's more practical for versioning tool's diffs:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/posts/2015-09-27-diff.png\\\" alt=\\\"Diff\\\"></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>It's consistent with the semicolon behavior.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>I would apply the same rule to functions definition, maps or anything which needs commas, like I wrote in this example:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\" data-language=\\\"swift\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-swift\\\"><code class=\\\"language-swift\\\"><span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// One-line, comma.</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">func</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">test</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>x<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token builtin\\\">Int</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> y<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token builtin\\\">Int</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Or:</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Multi-lines, no comma.</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">func</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">test</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>\\n  x<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token builtin\\\">Int</span>\\n  y<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token builtin\\\">Int</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>In Go, those notations are not frequent because the formatting rules are stricter. However, in a struct definition, you must write this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\" data-language=\\\"go\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-go\\\"><code class=\\\"language-go\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">type</span> Point <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">struct</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  X <span class=\\\"token builtin\\\">int</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  Y <span class=\\\"token builtin\\\">int</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p><em>(Note the trailing comma on the last line.)</em></p>\\n<p>It's better than what Swift does (at least, diffs are not impacted and you don't have to think to add or remove a comma — you just have to).</p>\\n<p>But why did they choose to keep the commas? No comma at all would have been way better AND coherent with the semicolon rule.</p>\\n<p>And you know what is even more inconsistent? This, which is perfectly valid Go code:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\" data-language=\\\"go\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-go\\\"><code class=\\\"language-go\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>\\n  x <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">1</span>\\n  y <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">2</span>\\n  z <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">3</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Yep, this time, there is nothing at all.</p>\"}}],\"pathPrefix\":\"articles\",\"first\":true,\"last\":false,\"index\":1,\"pageCount\":9,\"additionalContext\":{}}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---articles-b24bc427a78a5142785f.js","module.exports = {\"pathContext\":{\"group\":[{\"node\":{\"id\":\"/Users/ashen/Code/solarsailer.net/content/posts/2018-07-20-reboot.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":null,\"title\":\"Reboot\",\"date\":\"2018-07-20\",\"readableDate\":\"20 July 2018\",\"redirectFrom\":null,\"excerpt\":\"I have redesigned Solar Sailer, making the home page the most important one and refocusing this site as a way to find me on Internet.

Then, one day, GitHub said that they were deprecating the Markdown engine that I was using, affecting a few posts I wrote.</p>\\n<p>I wanted to redesign this site for a long time, so instead of just updating the posts, I decided to rewrite the whole blog (like every developer do each time they have a small change to do — it's our curse).</p>\\n<p>I experimented. I designed 6 or 8 layouts. I was never happy, and I never gave me the time to finish it properly. When I started to implement a new design, I let it wither for a few months. And when I came back, I just ditched it all. Again. And again. And again.</p>\\n<p>I moved the blog to <a href=\\\"https://gohugo.io\\\">Hugo</a>. Then I came back to Jekyll once more. I modernized everything. Then I was fed up with Jekyll again, so I tried <a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\\\">Gatsby</a>. And I did other things, abandoning the redesign once again. Meanwhile, and even if I had dozens of drafts, I couldn't update the old blog with new articles. So it languished there, in its infamous uglyness (something I was not proud of, calling myself a <em>designer</em>).</p>\\n<p>And finally, I retried Gatsby recently and completed a new design. It's not perfect. It's not well tested on older browsers. But it works, in a good enough way for me — I have already spent too much time on it.</p>\\n<p>It's time to ship.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>More than just a simple redesign, I wanted to reboot the site to add a <strong>portfolio</strong>, a <strong>resume</strong>, a <strong>documentation·codex·tutorials</strong>, as well as a <strong>photo</strong> and <strong>automation</strong> sections. Of course, if I wanted to do it all, I would never have finished anything, so I just focused on a simple redesign at the time being, keeping in mind that the site would be expanded later.</p>\\n<p>The goal, in the end, is to do all that, if I'm motivated enough. A good start would be to publish new articles with a regular schedule.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>Another thing that was ticking for this website was the \\\"deprecation\\\" of HTTP by Chrome in an upcoming update. By deprecation, I mean that Chrome will show an \\\"Unsecure\\\" flag on non-HTTPS websites. HTTP will always work, but it will be relegated to a legacy protocol that nobody should continue to use.</p>\\n<p>I was in a hurry to complete this reboot before this update. I soft-launched the new site a few weeks ago, and tweaked it since. And now it's official.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>To be a little bit exhaustive:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>I have 6 designs in Sketch files, plus a few more that I did directly in the browser.</li>\\n<li>I did more than 50 logos. And I'm still not satisfied by the one I use now (it's not the best that I did, but I think it fits better with the layout and what I wanted to do). It's so hard to capture the essence of something personal. It's a blank canvas without any constraints.</li>\\n<li>I tried 4 or 5 blog engines (<a href=\\\"http://jekyllrb.com\\\">Jekyll</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.metalsmith.io\\\">Metalsmith</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\\\">Gatsby</a>, <a href=\\\"https://gohugo.io\\\">Hugo</a> and others).

You shouldn’t have popular bugs. […] I added taverns to fortress mode, so the dwarves will go to a proper establishment, get mugs, and make orders, and they’ll drink in the mug. And, you know, things happen, mugs get spilled, there’s some alcohol on the ground.</p>\\n<p>Now, the cats would walk into the taverns, right, and because of the old blood footprint code from, like, eight years ago or something, they would get alcohol on their feet. It was originally so people could pad blood around, but now any liquid, right, so they get alcohol on their feet. And then I wanted to add cleaning stuff so when people were bathing, or I even made eyelids work for no reason, because I do random things sometimes. So cats will lick and clean themselves, and on a lark, when I made them clean themselves I’m like, ‘Well, it’s a cat. When you do lick cleaning, you actually ingest the thing that you’re cleaning off, right? They make hairballs, so they must swallow something, right?' And so the cats, when they cleaned the alcohol off their feet, they all got drunk. Because they were drinking.</p>\\n<p>But the numbers were off on that. I had never thought about, you know, activating inebriation syndromes back when I was adding the cleaning stuff. I was just like, ‘Well, they ingest it and they get a full dose,’ but a full dose is a whole mug of alcohol for a cat-sized creature, and it does all the blood alcohol size-based calculations, so the cats would get sick and vomit all over the tavern.</p>\\n<p>The original bug report is, ‘There’s cat vomit all over my tavern, and there’s a few dead cats,’ or whatever, and they’re like, ‘Why? This is broken.’</p>\\n<p>People helped me with this. We were all looking and figuring out, ‘What the heck is going on here?’, and that was the chain of events. It’s like doing the detective work to figure out that entire chain of events is what happened. You can see how adding just a tavern that gave the opportunity for spilling alcohol, which was really uncommon before, now all the spilled alcohol starts to, form in one location where something could start to happen. You activate bugs and little parts of code from eight, six years ago where you just didn’t balance the numbers because it didn’t matter. […]</p>\\n<p><strong>PC Gamer: So the cats’ inebriation system was just based on any organism would have the potential to get drunk.</strong></p>\\n<p>Yeah, right now it’s any creature that has blood, and that includes, like, an octopus. I don’t know if an octopus can get drunk or not.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The way the different systems are all interacting together is so fascinating. Especially when the outcome becomes something like this. :)</p>\\n<hr>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I don’t even use version control. If you don’t know what that is then you’re not gonna yell at me. If you even know what version control is you’re gonna be like, ‘You don’t use version control? You don’t use source control? What is wrong with you? How can you even work?’</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>I'm still baffled to know that many game developers (or other developers) work without version control.

Church</a>:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>First, let's cover the technical issues. It's verbose, combines the worst of both worlds between static and dynamic typing by having a hobbled but extremely clunky type system, and mandates running on a virtual machine (VM) that has a macroscopic startup time (not an issue for long-running servers, but painful for command-line applications). […]</p>\\n<p>The VM itself has a lot to recommend it. It offers concurrency and garbage collection at a level of quality that, until recently, wasn't found anywhere else. […] Much important software in the early 2000s was written in Java because, at the time, it was the best choice, even taking the mediocrity of the language itself into account. It had Unicode (albeit, UTF-16) from the start and a strong concurrency story, and it was a notch above C++ in terms of user experience. […]</p>\\n<p>If you put Java on a technical trial, it doesn't do so bad. The <em>language</em> sucks, the platform is pretty good for most purposes. I do hate the dominant interpretation of \\\"object-oriented programming\\\" with a passion, because it objectively sucks. […]</p>\\n<p>So let's talk about the political and cultural issues. First, the dominant Java culture is one of mediocrity and bad taste, with MetaModelVibratorVisitorFactory classes dominating. I've heard a number of experts on \\\"the Java issue\\\" argue that Java's biggest problem is the community, and that comes directly from the fact that good programmers don't want to deal with the bastardization of OOP that has entrenched itself in mainstream corporate development. You have a lot of people who trained up as \\\"Java programmers\\\", haven't seen a command line ever, and have no clue how the computer actually works. Most of them have never actually written a program; they just write classes and some Senior Chief Architect (who makes $246,001 per year and hasn't written a line of code since the 1990s) figures out how to stitch them together, and then tells some other clueless junior how to implement the glue in the gutshot hope that one will actually have the talent to make an actual working program out of the mess.</p>\\n<p>This isn't inherent to the JVM, because Clojure (currently hosted on the JVM, although its endgame seems to be language-agnosticism) has a radically different (and better) community. Scala's community is more mixed, but the top Scala engineers (the ones making tools like Spark and Kestrel) are really fucking good.</p>\\n<p>[…]</p>\\n<p>So, the short answer is: it's mostly not about the underlying platform (which is generally of high quality) and its only partly about the language (which is mediocre but can't be blamed directly for community problems). It goes a lot deeper than that, and not all of it is Java's fault. However, Java takes its share of the blame for its clear favoritism toward large programs (technically, established by its long startup time) and by its support of a very ugly (and counterproductive) variety of object-oriented programming.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.quora.com/Why-do-many-software-engineers-not-like-Java/answer/Stanley-Idesis\\\">Stanley Idesis</a>:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I’ve read the popular answers and will claim no contest to a majority of the complaints I found.

People have written many excellent OS libraries in Java for Android. The platform continues to be a hotbed of Java activity which developers contribute to from all over the world. […]</p>\\n<p>Android’s open nature, wide distribution, and powerful support from Google are almost enough to make Java hip again. […] Sure, some may argue that other runtimes and languages can enable the same capabilities of the device, but for whatever reason, Android chose Java.</p>\\n<p>Until Google changes its mind, Java will remain relevant and the source of fascinating developments in the software community as long as Android remains popular.</p>\\n</blockquote>\"}},{\"node\":{\"id\":\"/Users/ashen/Code/solarsailer.net/content/posts/2016-03-17-virtual-reality.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":null,\"title\":\"VR is not the future\",\"date\":\"2016-03-17\",\"readableDate\":\"17 March 2016\",\"redirectFrom\":null,\"excerpt\":\"Right now, journalists and tech companies are all buzzing and craving for VR.

It's in books, in movies, in games. In our collective mind, virtual reality is like flying cars: it's a dream that we always envisioned for our future as an high tech society.</p>\\n<p>Well, we all remember that we didn't get flying cars for the new millenium.</p>\\n<p>Incredible technologies portrayed in science-fiction books or movies are generally not really that relevant in reality. Or they are so hard to build that we can't even fathom to create them now. In our history, the way our society evolved was often very different to how we imagined it in our fictions. When you confront with the reality, many dreams are just what they are: dreams. I would need to dig up some sociology courses that I had—but I remember that this is a recurrent theme in our evolution.</p>\\n<p>For VR, it's a bit different: we (almost) have the technology. However, I do think that it's just a fad. A fad that excites many marketers or entrepreneurs. <em>Real-world applications are so narrow.</em></p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>VR is a cool demo. VR is impressive. Even with our primitive VR technologies, it's still incredible to try.<sup id=\\\"fnref-1\\\"><a href=\\\"#fn-1\\\" class=\\\"footnote-ref\\\">1</a></sup></p>\\n<p>VR is also making people sick—yes, many people suffer from motion sickness.</p>\\n<p>VR is pretty boring for games, its main application right now. Yes, the immersion is better. Nop, the controls are worse. You can't move in a game without hitting a wall. You can't use your hands without complex gloves or other utensils. The possibility are not that huge: okay, it might be great for some first-person games where you don't move. But that's just a small subset of all the games we can create.</p>\\n<p>VR is ugly. VR is cumbersome.

However, it's the lexer's role to add them, not the developer. <a href=\\\"http://zachholman.com/posts/shit-work/\\\">Let the machines do the shit work.</a></p>\\n<p>Here's the extract from <a href=\\\"https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#semicolons\\\">Effective Go</a>:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Like C, Go's formal grammar uses semicolons to terminate statements, but unlike in C, those semicolons do not appear in the source. Instead the lexer uses a simple rule to insert semicolons automatically as it scans, so the input text is mostly free of them.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>And unlike in an extremely <a href=\\\"http://blog.izs.me/post/2353458699/an-open-letter-to-javascript-leaders-regarding\\\">popular</a> <a href=\\\"http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2010/05/semicolons/\\\">language</a>, Go imposes some formatting rules to its programmers and nobody has a problem with <a href=\\\"http://inimino.org/~inimino/blog/javascript_semicolons\\\">ASI</a>.</p>\\n<p>However, there's still one perfectly valid case where semicolons are not optional:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\" data-language=\\\"go\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-go\\\"><code class=\\\"language-go\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">if</span> v <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">:=</span> math<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">Pow</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>x<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span> v <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span> limit <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\t<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> v\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Between <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">math.Pow(x, n)</code> and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">v &lt; limit</code>, you will find a semicolon. Because the two statements are on the same line, the compiler needs a semicolon to know where to end a statement and start the next one.</p>\\n<p>Basically, the rule is simple:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Do not use a semicolon when a statement ends with a newline.</li>\\n<li>Use a semicolon when a statement is followed by another statement on the same line.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>That's the basic consensus in new languages.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>So, here's my question: <strong>why don't we do the same thing with commas?!</strong></p>\\n<p>Let's look at the following snippet of Swift:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\" data-language=\\\"swift\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-swift\\\"><code class=\\\"language-swift\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> test <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"a\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"b\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"c\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>As you can see, each value of the array is separated by a comma. Same rule as the semicolons: if you are on the same line, use a separator. <em>In this case, it's a comma instead of the semicolon because the semantic is different.</em> Fine.</p>\\n<p>Now, let's look at the same snippet with a multi-lines notation — this example might seem contrived, but this kind of notation is clearer when the values are more complex and/or numerous:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\" data-language=\\\"swift\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-swift\\\"><code class=\\\"language-swift\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> example <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"a\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"b\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"c\\\"</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Wait. What. <strong>It's exactly like in the one-line declaration just above.</strong> Which is not surprising, because almost any language will do that.</p>\\n<p>That's inconsistent though. For semicolons, we omit them when there's a newline, but here, for a comma, we do not.</p>\\n<p>The correct syntax should be:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\" data-language=\\\"swift\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-swift\\\"><code class=\\\"language-swift\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> test <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"a\\\"</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"b\\\"</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"c\\\"</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Simpler, prettier. And it gives a few bonuses beyond the cosmetic aspect:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>It's less error-prone.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>It's more practical for versioning tool's diffs:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/posts/2015-09-27-diff.png\\\" alt=\\\"Diff\\\"></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>It's consistent with the semicolon behavior.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>I would apply the same rule to functions definition, maps or anything which needs commas, like I wrote in this example:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\" data-language=\\\"swift\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-swift\\\"><code class=\\\"language-swift\\\"><span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// One-line, comma.</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">func</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">test</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>x<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token builtin\\\">Int</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> y<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token builtin\\\">Int</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Or:</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Multi-lines, no comma.</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">func</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">test</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>\\n  x<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token builtin\\\">Int</span>\\n  y<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token builtin\\\">Int</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>In Go, those notations are not frequent because the formatting rules are stricter. However, in a struct definition, you must write this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\" data-language=\\\"go\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-go\\\"><code class=\\\"language-go\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">type</span> Point <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">struct</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  X <span class=\\\"token builtin\\\">int</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  Y <span class=\\\"token builtin\\\">int</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p><em>(Note the trailing comma on the last line.)</em></p>\\n<p>It's better than what Swift does (at least, diffs are not impacted and you don't have to think to add or remove a comma — you just have to).</p>\\n<p>But why did they choose to keep the commas? No comma at all would have been way better AND coherent with the semicolon rule.</p>\\n<p>And you know what is even more inconsistent? This, which is perfectly valid Go code:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\" data-language=\\\"go\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-go\\\"><code class=\\\"language-go\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>\\n  x <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">1</span>\\n  y <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">2</span>\\n  z <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">3</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Yep, this time, there is nothing at all.</p>\"}}],\"pathPrefix\":\"articles\",\"first\":true,\"last\":false,\"index\":1,\"pageCount\":9,\"additionalContext\":{}}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/articles.json\n// module id = 794\n// module chunks = 56932394960959"],"sourceRoot":""}
