It's a good way to not only use your close-sight during work.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>It's a simple habit, but it's hard to get used to it. For the last weeks, I forced myself to walk for 3 minutes every 1 hour of work.</p>\\n<p>And… it's great. I'm really feeling much more concentrated and ready.</p>\\n<p>Because I will forget to stand up as soon as I'm working, <a href=\\\"https://gist.github.com/solarsailer/6328415616b485ff7bef\\\">I've made a little \\\"app\\\" for OSX</a>. In fact, it's just a simple automator app that will trigger a notification for three minutes. Follow the gist above to know how to use it. It's dead simple, but <strong>it works</strong>.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>NB: this advice is especially true for self-employed people (because you can't take a break with your coworkers), but anybody working at a desk for several hours should do it. It costs nothing, and your body will love it.</p>\"}},{\"node\":{\"id\":\"/Users/ashen/Code/solarsailer.net/content/posts/2014-07-01-material-design.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":null,\"title\":\"Material Design\",\"date\":\"2014-07-01\",\"readableDate\":\"01 July 2014\",\"redirectFrom\":null,\"excerpt\":\"Material Design is the new Google's design language.

A <a href=\\\"http://www.google.com/design/\\\">comprehensive set of guidelines</a> with a lot of examples.</p>\\n<p>Unfortunately, there is some bullshit lines lurking inside the documentation…</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Create a visual language that synthesizes classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science. […]</p>\\n<p>A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion. The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Please, oh please, don't let marketing people write technical papers.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>I'm really eager to see how it will be implemented in Android &#x26; the Google web apps (if I understood well, the current Android L preview is not completely converted to Material Design yet).</p>\\n<p>There's still a lot of things that I don't like about Android and there's still a lot of rough edges (the awful black navigation bar, the heavy use of small typography, weird transitions &#x26; cie), but it's a great step forward for the platform. <em>And there's even a decent status bar now!</em></p>\\n<p>The real problem for Google is to force developers to adapt to the new style. It's the fourth Android redesign (if I recount well) and the majority of the Android apps are still looking bad. I hope that this time, developers will rejoice and follow Google's lead.</p>\"}},{\"node\":{\"id\":\"/Users/ashen/Code/solarsailer.net/content/posts/2014-06-03-design-detail-ios8-messages.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":null,\"title\":\"Design detail in iOS 8 Messages\",\"date\":\"2014-06-03\",\"readableDate\":\"03 June 2014\",\"redirectFrom\":null,\"excerpt\":\"One of the features that I wanted the most in iOS 8 was simple: Add a “Use Last Photo Taken” button in the Messages app.\",\"excerptQuote\":null},\"fields\":{\"path\":\"/2014/06/design-detail-ios8-messages/\",\"slug\":\"/2014/06/design-detail-ios8-messages/\"},\"html\":\"<p>One of the features that I wanted the most in iOS 8 was simple: add a <em>“Use Last Photo Taken”</em> button in the Messages app (along with the current \\\"Take Photo or Video\\\" and \\\"Choose Existing\\\").</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>The idea was originally thought by <a href=\\\"http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/12808983893/tweetbot-adds-last-photo-taken-feature\\\">Neven Mrgan</a> and later adopted by a lot of apps (Tweetbot, Slack, Droplr, etc.).</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <img\\n    src=\\\"/images/posts/2014-06-03-picker-tweetbot.png\\\"\\n    alt=\\\"Use “Last Photo Taken” in the Image Picker of Tweetbot 3\\\"\\n    title=\\\"Use “Last Photo Taken”\\\"\\n  >\\n  <figcaption>Example: the Image Picker from Tweetbot 3.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>But it was still missing in the one place where it would definitely shine: Messages.</p>\\n<p><strong>No more.</strong></p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>The way it was added is brilliant.
